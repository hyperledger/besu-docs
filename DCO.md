Developer Certificate of Origin
===============================

Per section 13.a of the
[Hyperledger Charter](https://www.hyperledger.org/about/charter-2), all code
submitted to the Hyperledger Foundation needs to have a
[Developer Certificate of Origin](http://developercertificate.org/) (DCO)
sign-off.

The sign-off needs to use your legal name, not a pseudonym. Git has a built-in
mechanism for this using the `-s` or `--signoff` argument to the `git commit`
command, providing your `user.name` and `user.email` are setup correctly.

For more information about DCO, see the
[Besu wiki](https://wiki.hyperledger.org/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=24772914).
If you have any questions, you can reach us on the
[Besu channel on Hyperledger Discord](https://discord.gg/hyperledger).
