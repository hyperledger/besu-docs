## Becoming a maintainer

Besu docs welcomes community contribution. Community members can progress to become a maintainer.
To become a maintainer the following steps occur, roughly in order.

- The proposed maintainer authors and has accepted five significant changes.
- The proposed maintainer has the sponsorship of at least one other maintainer.
    - This sponsoring maintainer will create a PR modifying the list of maintainers.
    - The proposed maintainer accepts the nomination and expresses a willingness to be a long-term
      (more than six months) committer.
    - This would be a comment in the above PR.
    - This PR will be communicated in all appropriate communication channels. It should be
    - All appropriate communication channels will advertise this PR, as well as mentioned in any
      maintainer/community call. It should also be posted to the appropriate mailing list or chat
      channels if they exist.
- Approval by at least three current maintainers within two weeks of the proposal or an absolute
  majority of current maintainers.
    - The PR modifying the list of maintainers keeps a record of these votes.
- No veto by another maintainer within two weeks of proposal are recorded.
    - Accompanying all vetoes must be a public explanation as a comment in the PR for adding this
      maintainer.
    - The explanation of the veto must be reasonable.
    - You can retract a veto, in which case the approval/veto timeframe is reset.
    - It's bad form to veto, retract, and veto again.
- The proposed maintainer becomes a maintainer:
    - Either two weeks have passed since the third approval,
    - Or an absolute majority of maintainers approve.
    - In either case, no maintainer presents a veto.

## Removing maintainers

Being a maintainer is not a status symbol or an indefinite title. It will
occasionally be necessary and appropriate to move a maintainer to emeritus status. This can occur
in the following situations:

- Resignation of a maintainer.
- Violation of the Code of Conduct warranting removal.
- Inactivity.
    - A general measure of inactivity will be no commits or code review comments for one reporting
      quarter, although this will not be strictly enforced if the maintainer expresses a reasonable
      intent to continue contributing.
    - A reasonable exception to inactivity is long term leave, such as parental leave or medical
      leave.
- Other unspecified circumstances.

Like adding a maintainer, the PR making the change records the governance process for moving a
maintainer to emeritus status.

Returning to active status from emeritus status uses the same steps as adding a new maintainer.
The emeritus maintainer already has the five required significant changes because there is no
contribution time horizon for those.
