## Becoming a maintainer

Besu doc welcomes community contribution. Community members can progress to
becoming maintainers. To become a maintainer the following steps, in
approximate order, occur:

- Five significant changes were authored by the proposed maintainer and
  accepted.
- The proposed maintainer has the sponsorship of at least one other maintainer.
  - This sponsoring maintainer creates a PR modifying the list of maintainers.
  - The proposed maintainer accepts the nomination and expresses a willingness
    to be a long-term (more than 6 months) committer.
  - This would be a comment in the PR.
  - This PR is communicated in all appropriate communication channels and
    mentioned in any maintainer/community call. The PR is also posted to the
    appropriate mailing lists or chat channels if they exist.
- Approval by at least 3 current maintainers within 2 weeks of the proposal or
  an absolute majority of current maintainers.
  - These votes are recorded in the PR modifying the list of maintainers.
- No veto by another maintainer within 2 weeks of proposal are recorded.
  - All vetoes must be accompanied by a public explanation as a comment in the
    PR for adding this maintainer
  - The explanation of the veto must be reasonable.
  - A veto can be retracted, in which case the approval/veto timeframe is
    reset.
  - It is bad form to veto, retract, and veto again.
- The proposed maintainer becomes a maintainer either:
  - Two weeks after the third approval, or
  - An absolute majority of maintainers approve.
  - And in either case, no maintainer presents a veto.

## Removing maintainers

Being a maintainer is not a status symbol or a title to be maintained
indefinitely. It is occasionally necessary and appropriate to move a maintainer
to emeritus status. This can occur in the following situations:

- Resignation of a maintainer
- Violation of the Code of Conduct warranting removal
- Inactivity:
  - A general measure of inactivity is no commits or code review comments for
    one reporting quarter, although this is not strictly enforced if the
    maintainer expresses a reasonable intent to continue contributing.
  - Reasonable exceptions to inactivity are granted for known long-term
    leave, such as parental leave and medical leave.
- Other unspecified circumstances.

Like adding a maintainer, a PR modifying the lists of maintainers and emeritus
maintainers records the change.

Returning to active status from emeritus status uses the same steps as adding a
new maintainer. Note that the emeritus maintainer already has the five required
significant changes because there is no contribution time horizon for those.
