# Hyperledger Security Policy

## Reporting a Security Bug

If you think you have discovered a security issue in any of the Hyperledger projects, we'd love to
hear from you. We will take all security bugs seriously and if confirmed upon investigation we will
patch it within a reasonable amount of time and release a public security bulletin discussing the
impact and credit the discoverer.

You can report a security bug in two ways. The easiest is to email a description of the flaw and
any related information (for example reproduction steps, version) to
[Hyperledger security email address`](mailto:security@hyperledger.org).

<!-- FIXME form doesn't have a "Security Level" field.
The other way is to file a confidential security bug in our
[JIRA bug tracking system](https://jira.hyperledger.org/projects/BESU/). Be sure to set the "Security Level" to
"Security issue".
-->

The process by which the Hyperledger Security Team handles security bugs is documented further in
our [Defect Response page](https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/SEC/Defect+Response) on our
[wiki](https://wiki.hyperledger.org).
