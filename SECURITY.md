# Hyperledger security policy

## Reporting a security bug

If you think you have discovered a security issue in any of the Hyperledger projects, we want to
hear from you. We take all security bugs seriously and if confirmed upon investigation, we will
patch it within a reasonable amount of time and release a public security bulletin discussing the
impact and credit the discoverer.

To report a security bug:

* Email a description of the flaw and any related information (for example, reproduction steps,
  version, and so on) to [security at hyperledger dot org](mailto:security@hyperledger.org). This
  is the easiest way to report a security bug.
* File a confidential security bug in our [JIRA bug tracking system](https://jira.hyperledger.org).
  Be sure to set the **Security Level** to “Security issue”.

For more information about the process by which the Hyperledger Security Team handles security bugs,
see the
[Hyperledger defect response wiki page](https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/SEC/Defect+Response).
