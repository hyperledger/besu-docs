# Client Libraries

Client libraries such as web3.js, web3j, or ethereumj are used by Dapps to forward JSON-RPC requests to Hyperledger Besu. Dapps can use any
client library that implements the core Ethereum RPC methods.

The web3.js-eea library can be used with Hyperledger Besu for privacy features.

Client libraries can also be used to [create signed transactions](../HowTo/Develop-Dapps/Use-web3js.md). Use the web3.js-eea library to [create and send private transactions](../HowTo/Send-Transactions/Creating-Sending-Private-Transactions.md).
