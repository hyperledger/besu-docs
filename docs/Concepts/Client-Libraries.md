# Client libraries

Dapps use client libraries, such as [web3.js](https://github.com/ethereum/web3.js/),
[web3j](https://github.com/web3j/web3j), or [ethereumj](https://github.com/ethereum/ethereumj), to
forward JSON-RPC requests to Hyperledger Besu. Any client library implementing core Ethereum RPC
methods works with Besu.

Use the [web3js-eea library](../HowTo/Interact/Client-Libraries/web3js-eea.md) with Besu for
[privacy features](../Concepts/Privacy/Privacy-Overview.md).

Use client libraries to:

* [Create signed transactions](../HowTo/Develop-Dapps/Web3js.md)
* [Create and send private transactions].
