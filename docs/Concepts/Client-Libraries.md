# Client Libraries

Client libraries such as web3.js, web3j, or ethereumj are used by Dapps to forward JSON-RPC requests to Hyperledger Besu. Any
client library that implements core Ethereum RPC methods can be used with Besu.

The web3.js-eea library can be used with Besu for [privacy features](../Concepts/Privacy/Privacy-Overview.md).

Client libraries can also be used to [create signed transactions](../HowTo/Develop-Dapps/Use-web3js.md). Use the web3.js-eea library to [create and send private transactions](../HowTo/Send-Transactions/Creating-Sending-Private-Transactions.md).
