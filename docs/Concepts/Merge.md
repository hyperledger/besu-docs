# The Merge

The Ethereum upgrade known as "[The Merge](https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/merge/)" combines the
[Beacon Chain](https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/beacon-chain/) with Ethereum Mainnet.

## Execution and consensus clients

You can run Besu as an execution client on Ethereum Mainnet using the same
[installation options](../HowTo/Get-Started/Installation-Options).

You can
[test Besu as an execution client on the Kiln testnet](../HowTo/Get-Started/Starting-node.md#run-a-node-on-kiln-testnet).

## Proof of stake

After The Merge, Ethereum Mainnet will use
[proof of stake](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/consensus-mechanisms/pos/) consensus.
