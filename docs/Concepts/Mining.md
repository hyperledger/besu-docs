# Mining

Hyperledger Besu supports CPU and GPU mining, which are
[configured using command line options](../HowTo/Configure/Configure-Mining.md).

GPU mining support testing used [Ethminer](https://github.com/ethereum-mining/ethminer) with the
`stratum+tcp` and `getwork` schemes.

!!! note
    Some mining software supports the `getwork` scheme as the `http` scheme.
