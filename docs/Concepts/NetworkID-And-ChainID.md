# Network ID and chain ID

Ethereum networks have two identifiers, a network ID and a chain ID. Although they often have the
same value, they have different uses.

Peer-to-peer communication between nodes uses the _network ID_, while the transaction signature
process uses the _chain ID_.

!!! note

    [EIP-155](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/blob/master/EIPS/eip-155.md) introduced using
    the chain ID as part of the transaction signing process to protect against transaction
    replay attacks.

For most networks, including MainNet and the public testnets, the network ID and the chain ID are
the same, with the network ID defaulting to the chain ID, as specified in the genesis file.

!!! example "Chain ID in the Genesis File"

    ```json
    {
      "config": {
        "ethash": {
        },
         "chainID": 1981
      },
      ...
    }
    ```

Besu sets the chain ID (and by default the network ID) automatically, using either the
[`--genesis-file`](../Reference/CLI/CLI-Syntax.md#genesis-file) option or when specifying a
network using the [`--network`](../Reference/CLI/CLI-Syntax.md#network) option. The following
table lists the available networks and their chain and network IDs.

| Network   | Chain | Chain ID | Network ID | Type        |
|-----------|-------|----------|------------|-------------|
| `mainnet` | ETH   | 1        | 1          | Production  |
| `ropsten` | ETH   | 3        | 3          | Test        |
| `rinkeby` | ETH   | 4        | 4          | Test        |
| `goerli`  | ETH   | 5        | 5          | Test        |
| `dev`     | ETH   | 2018     | 2018       | Development |
| `classic` | ETC   | 61       | 1          | Production  |
| `mordor`  | ETC   | 63       | 7          | Test        |
| `kotti`   | ETC   | 6        | 6          | Test        |

## Specify a different network ID

Usually the network ID is the same as the chain ID, but if you want to separate specific nodes from
the rest of the network so they can't connect or synchronize with other nodes, you can override the
default network ID for those nodes using the
[`--network-id`](../Reference/CLI/CLI-Syntax.md#network-id) option.
