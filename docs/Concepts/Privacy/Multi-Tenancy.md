# Multi-tenancy

By default, each participant in a privacy network uses its own Besu and Orion
node.

Multi-tenancy allows multiple participants to use the same Besu and
Orion node. Each participant is called a Tenant, and the Operator is the
owner of the Besu and Orion node.

!!! important
    The Operator is responsible for [configuring multi-tenancy](../../Tutorials/Privacy/Configuring-Multi-Tenancy.md), and has 
    access to all tenant data.

!!! important
    Ensure the multi-tenant Orion node client API is configured to allow access only by the multi-tenant Besu node. Access to your data is secured through Besu using multi-tenancy mode.

    If not configured to allow access only by the multi-tenant Besu node, other Orion clients including other Besu nodes may be able to access tenant data.

Multi-tenancy validates that tenants are permitted to use the specified HTTP or
Websocket JSON-RPC requests, and the tenant has access to the requested privacy
data. Private data is segregated, and each tenant uses a JWT token for
authentication.

The JWT token can be created [externally or internally](../../HowTo/Interact/APIs/Authentication.md).
