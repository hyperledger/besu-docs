# Onchain Privacy Groups

Onchain privacy groups use smart contracts to store and maintain the group membership. You can add
and remove members to and from onchain privacy groups.

!!! important

    Onchain privacy groups are an early access feature. Do not use in production networks.

    Onchain privacy groups are not supported with [multi-tenancy](Multi-Tenancy.md).

    The onchain privacy group interfaces might change between releases. There might not be an
    upgrade path from onchain privacy groups created using v1.4 to enable use of onchain privacy
    group functionality in future versions.

    It's not recommended to create onchain privacy groups in a chain with existing
    [offchain privacy groups](Privacy-Groups.md).

## Group Management Contracts

The privacy group management contract bytecode is hard-coded into Hyperledger Besu and when you
create a privacy group, the contract bytecode is part of the genesis state of the privacy group.

!!! caution

    All members of an onchain privacy group must be using the same version of Hyperledger Besu. If
    using different versions, the private state within the privacy group may become inconsistent.

The provided group management contracts do not enforce any permissioning on group members. That is,
any member of a group can make transactions in the group, and add or remove group members.

## Onchain Privacy Group IDs

When creating an onchain privacy group, generate the privacy group ID for the group outside of Besu
and pass the ID as a parameter.

The [web3js-eea library](../../HowTo/Use-Privacy/Use-OnChainPrivacy.md) generates a unique privacy
group ID and passes the ID to Besu when creating a privacy group.

!!! caution

    When generating a privacy group ID, you must ensure the ID is unique across all network
    participants. If you create a privacy group with an existing privacy group ID, the existing
    privacy group is overwritten.

    To ensure unique privacy group IDs, using 256-bit SecureRandom is recommended.
