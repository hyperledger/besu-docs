# Onchain Privacy Groups

Onchain privacy groups use smart contracts to store and maintain the group membership.
You can add and remove members to and from onchain privacy groups.

!!! important
    Onchain privacy groups are an early access feature in v1.4. Do not use in production networks.

    The onchain privacy group interfaces may change between v1.4 and v1.5. There may not be an upgrade
    path from onchain privacy groups created using v1.4 to enable use of onchain privacy group functionality
    in future versions.

    We do not recommend creating onchain privacy groups in a chain with existing [offchain privacy groups](Privacy-Groups.md).

## Group Management Contracts

The privacy group management contract bytecode is hard-coded into Hyperledger Besu and when a privacy
group is created, the contract bytecode is part of the genesis state of the privacy group.

!!! caution
    All members of an onchain privacy group must be using the same version of Hyperledger Besu. If
    using different versions, the private state within the privacy group may become inconsistent.

The provided group management contracts do not enforce any permissioning on group members. That is, any
member of a group can make transactions in the group, and add or remove group members.

## Onchain Privacy Group IDs

Privacy group IDs for onchain privacy group must be generated outside of Hyperledger Besu and are passed
as a parameter when creating an onchain privacy group.

The [web3js-eea library](../../HowTo/Use-Privacy/Use-OnChainPrivacy.md) generates a unique privacy
group ID and passes the ID to Hyperledger Besu when creating a privacy group.

!!! caution
    When generating a privacy group ID, you must ensure the ID is unique across all network
    participants. If a privacy group is created with an existing privacy group ID, the existing
    privacy group is overwritten.

    We recommend using 256 bit SecureRandom to ensure unique privacy group IDs.
