# Privacy groups

A privacy group is a group of nodes identified by a unique privacy group ID by Orion. Orion stores
each private transaction with the privacy group ID.

The Besu nodes maintain the public world state for the blockchain and a private state for each
privacy group. The private states contain data that is not shared in the globally replicated world
state.

!!! important

    The privacy group implementations described below are offchain privacy groups and cannot have
    their group membership updated.

    [Onchain privacy groups are an early access feature](Onchain-PrivacyGroups.md).

## Privacy types

Besu implements two types of privacy:

* Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA) privacy, where private transactions include `privateFor` as
  the recipient.
* Besu-extended privacy, where private transactions include `privacyGroupId` as the recipient.

Both privacy types create privacy groups and store private transactions with their privacy group in
Orion.

!!! note

    For clarity, the Orion nodes are not shown in the previous diagram. To send private
    transactions, each Besu node must have an associated Orion node.

### Access between states

A contract in a privacy group:

* Can read or write to a contract in the same privacy group.
* Can read from the public state including public contracts.
* Cannot access contracts from a different privacy group.

A public contract cannot access a private contract.

### Enterprise Ethereum Alliance privacy

In the privacy implementation complying with the
[EEA Client Specification](https://entethalliance.org/technical-documents/) the group of nodes
specified by `privateFrom` and `privateFor` form a privacy group with a unique privacy group ID
provided by Orion.

!!! example

    The previous diagram illustrates two privacy groups enabling:

    * A, B, and C to send transactions that are private from D.
    * A, C, and D to send transactions that are private from B.

    Using EEA-compliant privacy, to send private transactions between A, B, and C, A initializes a
    contract in a private transaction with B and C specified as the `privateFor` and A specified as
    the `privateFrom`. Initializing the contract creates a privacy group consisting of A, B, and C.
    For the ABC private state to remain consistent, A, B, and C must be included on transactions
    (as either `privateFrom` or `privateFor`) even if they are between only two of the three
    parties.

    To send private transactions between A, C, and D, C initializes a different contract in a
    private transaction with A and D specified as the `privateFor` and C specified as the
    `privateFrom`. Initializing the contract creates a privacy group consisting of  A, C, and D.
    For the ACD private state to remain consistent, A, C, and D must be included on transactions
    (as either `privateFrom` or `privateFor`) even if they are between only two of the three
    parties.

### Besu-extended privacy

The Besu-extended privacy implementation creates a privacy group using
[`priv_createPrivacyGroup`](../../Reference/API-Methods.md#priv_createprivacygroup) with private
transactions sent to the privacy group ID.

!!! example

    Using the same privacy groups as in the previous example.

    Using Besu-extended privacy, to send private transactions between A, B, and C, A creates a
    privacy group consisting of A, B, and C. The privacy group ID is specified when sending private
    transactions and A, B, and C are recipients of all private transactions sent to the privacy
    group.

    To send private transactions between A, C, and D, A creates a privacy group consisting of A, C,
    and D. The privacy group ID of this group is specified when sending private transactions with A,
    C, and D as recipients.
