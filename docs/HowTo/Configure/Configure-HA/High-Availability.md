# High availability of JSON-RPC and RPC Pub/Sub APIs

To enable high availability to the
[RPC Pub/Sub API over WebSockets](../../Interact/APIs/RPC-PubSub.md) or the
[JSON-RPC API](../../Interact/APIs/Using-JSON-RPC-API.md), run and synchronize more than one
Hyperledger Besu nodes to the network. Use a load balancer to distribute requests across nodes in
the cluster that are ready to receive requests.

![Load Balancer](../../../images/LoadBalancer.png)

!!! important

    We do not recommend putting [bootnodes](../../Deploy/Bootnodes.md) behind a load balancer.

## Determining when a node is ready

Use the
[readiness endpoint](../../Interact/APIs/Using-JSON-RPC-API.md#readiness-and-liveness-endpoints) to
determine when a node is ready.

!!! note

    The minimum number of peers and number of blocks from the best known block for determining if a
    node considered ready is deployment specific.

## Transaction nonces

Besu obtains the nonce for the next transaction using
[`eth_getTransactionCount`](../../../Reference/API-Methods.md#eth_gettransactioncount). The nonce
depends on the transactions in the
[transaction pool](../../../Concepts/Transactions/Transaction-Pool.md). If sending
[`eth_getTransactionCount`](../../../Reference/API-Methods.md#eth_gettransactioncount) and
[`eth_sendRawTransaction`](../../../Reference/API-Methods.md#eth_sendrawtransaction) requests for a
specific account to more than one node, the
[`eth_getTransactionCount`](../../../Reference/API-Methods.md#eth_gettransactioncount) results
might be incorrect.

!!! note

    If using [private transactions](../../../Concepts/Privacy/Privacy-Overview.md), retrieve the
    nonce using
    [`priv_getTransactionCount`](../../../Reference/API-Methods.md#priv_gettransactioncount) or
    [`priv_getEeaTransactionCount`](../../../Reference/API-Methods.md#priv_geteeatransactioncount)
    and send the private transactions using
    [`eea_sendRawTransaction`](../../../Reference/API-Methods.md#eea_sendrawtransaction).

To get correct nonces when distributing requests across a cluster, either:

* Track the next nonce outside of the Besu node (as MetaMask does)
* Configure the load balancer in sticky mode to send requests from a specific account to a single
  node, unless that node is unavailable.

## Subscriptions

You can subscribe to events using:

* [RPC Pub/Sub over WebSockets](../../Interact/APIs/RPC-PubSub.md)
* [Filters over HTTP](../../Interact/Filters/Accessing-Logs-Using-JSON-RPC.md).

We recommend using [RPC Pub/Sub over WebSockets](../../Interact/APIs/RPC-PubSub.md) because
WebSockets connections associate with a specific node and do not require using the load balancer in
sticky mode.

If using [filters over HTTP](../../Interact/Filters/Accessing-Logs-Using-JSON-RPC.md), configure
the load balancer in sticky mode to associate the subscription with a specific node.

## Recovering from dropped subscriptions

Dropped subscriptions can occur because of:

* A disconnected WebSockets connection
* The removal of the node serving the subscription from the ready pool.

If there is a dropped subscription, missed events might occur while reconnecting to a different
node. To recover dropped messages, create another subscription and follow the process for that
[subscription type](../../Interact/APIs/RPC-PubSub.md#subscribing):

* [`newHeads`](#new-headers)
* [`logs`](#logs)
* [`newPendingTransactions`](#new-pending-transactions)
* [`droppedPendingTransactions`](#dropped-pending-transactions)
* [`syncing`](#syncing).

### New headers

To request information on blocks from the last block before the subscription dropped to the first
block received from the new subscription, use
[`eth_getBlockByNumber`](../../../Reference/API-Methods.md#eth_getblockbynumber).

### Logs

To request logs from the block number of the last log received before the subscription dropped to
the current chain head, use [`eth_getLogs`](../../../Reference/API-Methods.md#eth_getlogs).

### New pending transactions

To request all pending transactions for the new node, use
[`txpool_besuTransactions`](../../../Reference/API-Methods.md#txpool_besutransactions).

!!! note

    Nodes do not all store the same pending transactions.

### Dropped pending transactions

To request all pending transactions for the new node, use
[`txpool_besuTransactions`](../../../Reference/API-Methods.md#txpool_besutransactions).

!!! note

    Nodes do not all store the same pending transactions.

### Syncing

The syncing state of each node is specific to that node. To retrieve the syncing state of the new
node, use [`eth_syncing`](../../../Reference/API-Methods.md#eth_syncing).
