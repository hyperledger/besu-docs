# Mining

## Configure CPU mining

To enable CPU mining, start Hyperledger Besu with the following options:

```bash
besu --rpc-http-api=ETH,MINER --miner-enabled --miner-coinbase=<account>
```

Where `<account>` is the account you pay mining rewards to. For example,
`fe3b557e8fb62b89f4916b721be55ceb828dbd73`.

Start and stop mining using the [`miner_start`](../../Reference/API-Methods.md#miner_start) and
[`miner_stop`](../../Reference/API-Methods.md#miner_stop) APIs.

## Configure GPU mining

Besu supports GPU mining, tested using [Ethminer](https://github.com/ethereum-mining/ethminer) with
the `stratum+tcp` scheme.

To enable GPU mining, start Hyperledger Besu with the following options:

```bash
besu --rpc-http-api=ETH,MINER --miner-enabled --miner-stratum-enabled --miner-coinbase=<account>
```

Where `<account>` is the account you pay mining rewards to. For example,
`fe3b557e8fb62b89f4916b721be55ceb828dbd73`.

Optional command line options are:

* [`--miner-stratum-host`](../../Reference/CLI/CLI-Syntax.md#miner-stratum-host) to specify the
  host of the mining service.
* [`--miner-stratum-port`](../../Reference/CLI/CLI-Syntax.md#miner-stratum-port) to specify the
  port of the mining service.

!!! note

    Besu also supports the `getwork` scheme. Use the
    [`--miner-stratum-enabled`](../../Reference/CLI/CLI-Syntax.md#miner-stratum-enabled) option and
    [enable the `ETH` RPCs](../../Reference/CLI/CLI-Syntax.md#rpc-http-api).

    The `getwork` scheme is supported as the `http` scheme in certain mining software.

Start and stop mining using the [`miner_start`](../../Reference/API-Methods.md#miner_start) and
[`miner_stop`](../../Reference/API-Methods.md#miner_stop) APIs.

## Mining APIs

The JSON-RPC API methods for mining are:

* [`miner_start`](../../Reference/API-Methods.md#miner_start) to start mining.
* [`miner_stop`](../../Reference/API-Methods.md#miner_stop) to stop mining.
* [`eth_mining`](../../Reference/API-Methods.md#eth_mining) to determine whether the client is
  actively mining new blocks.
* [`eth_hashrate`](../../Reference/API-Methods.md#eth_hashrate) to get the number of hashes per
  second with which the node is mining. Not supported for GPU mining.
* [`eth_getWork`](../../Reference/API-Methods.md#eth_getwork) to get the hash of the current block,
  the seed hash, and the target boundary condition. Only used when using the `getwork`
  scheme.
* [`eth_submitWork`](../../Reference/API-Methods.md#eth_submitwork) to submit the PoW solution.
  Only used when using the `getwork` scheme.
