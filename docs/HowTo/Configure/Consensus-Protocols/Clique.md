# Clique

Besu implements the Clique Proof-of-Authority (PoA) consensus protocol. The Rinkeby testnet uses
Clique and private networks can also use Clique.

In Clique networks, approved accounts, known as signers, validate transactions and blocks. Signers
take turns to create the next block.
Existing signers propose and vote to [add or remove signers](Add-Validators.md#clique).

## Genesis file

To use Clique in a private network, Besu requires a Clique genesis file. When connecting to Rinkeby,
Besu uses the
[`rinkeby.json`](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/blob/master/config/src/main/resources/rinkeby.json)
genesis file in the `/besu/config/src/main/resources` directory.

A Clique genesis file defines properties specific to Clique.

!!! example "Sample Clique Genesis File"

    ```json
    {
      "config":{
        "chainId":1981,
        "constantinoplefixblock": 0,
        "clique":{
          "blockperiodseconds":15,
          "epochlength":30000
        }
      },
      "coinbase":"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
      "difficulty":"0x1",
      "extraData":"0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001a54556254bfa3db2daa7673435ec63649925c50000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
      "gasLimit":"0x1fffffffffffff",
      "mixHash":"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
      "nonce":"0x0",
      "timestamp":"0x5c51a607",
      "alloc": {},
      "number":"0x0",
      "gasUsed":"0x0",
      "parentHash":"0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
    }
    ```

The properties specific to Clique are:

* `blockperiodseconds` - The block time, in seconds.
* `epochlength` - The number of blocks after which to reset all votes.
* `extraData` - Vanity data takes up the first 32 bytes, followed by the initial signers.

### Extra data

The `extraData` field consists of:

* 0x prefix.
* 32 bytes (64 hex characters) of vanity data.
* A concatenated list of initial signer addresses (at least one initial signer required). 20 bytes
  (40 hex characters) for each signer.
* 65 bytes (130 hex characters) for the proposer signature. In the genesis block there is no
  initial proposer so the proposer signature is all zeros.

## Connecting to a Clique network

To connect to the Rinkeby testnet, start Besu with the
[`--network=rinkeby`](../../../Reference/CLI/CLI-Syntax.md#network) command line option. To start a
node on a Clique private network, use the
[`--genesis-file`](../../../Reference/CLI/CLI-Syntax.md#genesis-file) option to specify the custom
genesis file.

<!-- Acronyms and Definitions -->

*[vanity data]: Signers can include anything they like as vanity data.
