# Static Nodes

Static nodes are a configured set of trusted nodes. Static nodes are exempt from
[maximum peer](Managing-Peers.md#limiting-peers) and
[remote connection](Managing-Peers.md#limiting-remote-connections) limits.

Besu attempts to maintain connections with static nodes by periodically initiating a connection to
any unconnected static node.

!!! tip

    Bootnodes and static nodes are parallel methods for finding peers. Depending on your use case,
    you can use only bootnodes, only static nodes, or both bootnodes and statics nodes. For
    example, you run multiple nodes on MainNet (discovery using bootnodes), but want to ensure your
    nodes are always connected (using static nodes).

    To find peers, configure one or more [bootnodes](Bootnodes.md). To configure a specific set of
    peer connections, use static nodes, as described below.

## Configure static nodes

To configure a network of static nodes:

1. List the [enode URLs](../../Concepts/Node-Keys.md#enode-url) of the nodes in the
   [`static-nodes.json` file](#static-nodesjson-file).

1. Save the `static-nodes.json` file in the data directory (specified by
   [`--data-path`](../../Reference/CLI/CLI-Syntax.md#data-path)) of each node.

1. Start Besu with discovery disabled using
   [`--discovery-enabled=false`](../../Reference/CLI/CLI-Syntax.md#discovery-enabled).

To update the list of static peers at run time, use the
[`admin_addPeer`](../../Reference/API-Methods.md#admin_addpeer) and
[`admin_removePeer`](../../Reference/API-Methods.md#admin_removepeer) JSON-RPC API methods.

!!! note

    Runtime modifications of static nodes are not persisted between runs. The `static-nodes.json`
    file is not updated by the `admin_addPeer` and `admin_removePeer` methods.

    Nodes not in the list of the static nodes are not prevented from connecting. To prevent nodes
    from connecting, use [Permissioning](../../Concepts/Permissioning/Permissioning-Overview.md).

!!! tip

    If the added peer does not appear in the peer list (returned by
    [`admin_peers`](../../Reference/API-Methods.md#admin_peers)), check the the supplied
    [enode URL](../../Concepts/Node-Keys.md#enode-url) is correct, the node is running, and the
    node is listening for TCP connections on the endpoint.

### `static-nodes.json` file

The `static-nodes.json` file must be in the data directory (specified by
[`--data-path`](../../Reference/CLI/CLI-Syntax.md#data-path)) and contain a JSON array of
[enode URLs](../../Concepts/Node-Keys.md#enode-url).

!!! example

    ```json
    [
    "enode://cea71cb65a471037e01508cebcc178f176f9d5267bf29507ea1f6431eb6a5dc67d086dc8dc54358a72299dab1161febc5d7af49d1609c69b42b5e54544145d4f@127.0.0.1:30303",
    "enode://ca05e940488614402705a6b6836288ea902169ecc67a89e1bd5ef94bc0d1933f20be16bc881ffb4be59f521afa8718fc26eec2b0e90f2cd0f44f99bc8103e60f@127.0.0.1:30304"
    ]
    ```

!!! note

    Each node has a `static-nodes.json` file. We recommend each node in the network has the same
    `static-nodes.json` file.
