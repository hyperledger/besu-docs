# Install Binary Distribution

## MacOS with Homebrew

### Prerequisites

* [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
* Java JDK

!!!important
    Hyperledger Besu requires:
    
      * MacOS High Sierra 10.13 or later versions
      * Java 11+ to compile; earlier versions are not supported. You can install Java using `brew cask install adoptopenjdk`. Alternatively, you can manually install the [Java JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html).

### Install Using Homebrew

brew tap hyperledger/besu
brew install besu
```
Display Besu command line help to confirm installation:

```bash

```

## Linux / Unix / Windows

### Prerequisites

* [Java JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html)

!!!attention
    Besu requires Java 11+ to compile; earlier versions are not supported.
    Besu is currently supported only on 64-bit versions of Windows, and requires a 64-bit version of JDK/JRE.
    We recommend that you also remove any 32-bit JDK/JRE installations.

!!! note "Linux Open File Limit"
    If synchronizing to MainNet on Linux or other chains with large data requirements, increase the maximum
    number of open files allowed using `ulimit`. If the open files limit is not high enough, a `Too many open files` RocksDB exception occurs.

### Install from Packaged Binaries

Download the Besu [packaged binaries](https://pegasys.tech/solutions/hyperledger-besu/).

Unpack the downloaded files and change into the `besu-<release>` directory.

Display Besu command line help to confirm installation:

```bash tab="Linux/macOS"
