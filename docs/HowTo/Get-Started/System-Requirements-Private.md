# System requirements for private networks

The system requirements for private networks depend on different factors, including the:

* Size of the world state for the network.
* Number of transactions submitted to the network.
* [Block gas limit](../../Reference/Config-Items.md#genesis-block-parameters).
* Number and complexity of [JSON-RPC](../Interact/APIs/Using-JSON-RPC-API.md),
  [PubSub](../Interact/APIs/RPC-PubSub.md), or [GraphQL](../Interact/APIs/GraphQL.md) queries
  handled by the node.

## Determining system requirements

To determine system requirements, check CPU and disk space requirements using
[Prometheus](../Monitor/Metrics.md#monitor-node-performance-using-prometheus). Grafana provides a
[sample dashboard](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/10273) for Besu.

## Java Virtual Machine size

Depending on your environment and network setup, the minimum Java Virtual
Machine (JVM) memory requirement for private networks is 4GB.

JVM memory requirements are highest when syncing, but will reduce after the node is synchronized
to the chain head. Monitor your system to determine your actual JVM memory needs.

## VM requirements

If you set up your own VM locally using a VM manager such as [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/):

* Ensure you enable Intel Virtualization Technology (VTx) and Virtualization Technology for
  Directed I/O (VT-d) in the BIOS settings.
* On Windows, you might need to disable Hyper-V in the Windows Feature list.

We recommend you create a VM with the following attributes:

* Memory Size: Set to 4096 MB (recommended)
* Create a virtual hard disk with at least 10 GB (20 GB recommended)
* Virtual hard disk file type: VDI (if you need to share it with other apps, use VHD)
* (Optional) You can create a shared directory to copy block files or genesis files from the host
  computer to the VM. For details on how to create a shared directory, see "Share Folders" in the
  [Oracle VirtualBox documentation].
