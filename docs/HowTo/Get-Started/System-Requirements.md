title: Hyperledger Besu System Requirements
description: System requirements to sync and run Besu

# System requirements

The system requirements for Hyperledger Besu depend on different factors, including the:

* Size of the world state for the network.
* Number of transactions submitted to the network.
* [Block gas limit](../../Reference/Config-Items.md#genesis-block-parameters).
* Number and complexity of [JSON-RPC](../Interact/APIs/Using-JSON-RPC-API.md),
  [PubSub](../Interact/APIs/RPC-PubSub.md), or [GraphQL](../Interact/APIs/GraphQL.md) queries
  handled by the node.

## Determining system requirements

To determine system requirements, check CPU and disk space requirements using
[Prometheus](../Monitor/Metrics.md#monitor-node-performance-using-prometheus). Grafana provides a
[sample dashboard](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/10273) for Besu.

!!! tip

    CPU requirements are highest when syncing to the network and typically reduce after the node is
    synchronized to the chain head.

## RAM

Besu requires 4GB of RAM. For public Ethereum networks, including MainNet and testnets such as
Ropsten, Besu requires a minimum of 8GB of RAM.

## Disk space

!!! caution

    Do not use pruning in Hyperledger Besu v1.4.0. Pruning has a
    [known bug](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#known-issues).

    If using fast sync in v1.4.0, explicitly disable pruning using
    [`--pruning-enabled=false`](../../Reference/CLI/CLI-Syntax.md#pruning-enabled).

Syncing to the Ethereum Mainnet requires 3TB for a full sync. To reduce the disk space required,
use [pruning](../../Concepts/Pruning.md). With pruning, we recommend approximately 750GB
of available disk space.

## VM requirements

You can run Besu on a virtual machine (VM) on a cloud service, such as AWS or Azure, or locally
using a VM manager, such as [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/).

If you set up your own VM locally using a VM manager, there are a few considerations:

* Ensure you enable Intel Virtualization Technology (VTx) and Virtualization Technology for
  Directed I/O (VT-d) in the BIOS settings.
* On Windows, you might need to disable Hyper-V in the Windows Feature list.

We recommend you create a VM with the following attributes:

* Memory Size: Set to 4096 MB (recommended)
* Create a virtual hard disk with at least 10 GB (20 GB recommended)
* Virtual hard disk file type: VDI (if you need to share it with other apps, use VHD)
* (Optional) You can create a shared directory to copy block files or genesis files from the host
  computer to the VM. For details on how to create a shared directory, see "Share Folders" in the
  [Oracle VirtualBox documentation].
