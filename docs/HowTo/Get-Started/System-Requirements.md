# System Requirements 

The system requirements for Hyperledger Besu depend on a number of factors: 

* Size of the world state for the network
* Number of transactions submitted to network 
* [Block gas limit](../../Reference/Config-Items.md#genesis-block-parameters)
* Number and complexity of [JSON-RPC](../Interact/APIs/Using-JSON-RPC-API.md), [PubSub](../Interact/APIs/RPC-PubSub.md), 
or [GraphQL](../Interact/APIs/GraphQL.md) queries being handled by the node 

## Determining System Requirements  

To determine system requirements, monitor CPU and disk space requirements using [Prometheus](../Deploy/Monitoring-Performance.md#monitor-node-performance-using-prometheus). 
A sample [Grafana dashboard](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/10273) is provided for Besu. 

!!! tip
    CPU requirements are highest when syncing to the network and typically reduce once the node is synchronized to the chain head. 

## RAM 

Besu requires 4GB of RAM. For Ethereum Mainnet, a minimum of 8GB of RAM is required. 

## Disk Space 

Syncing to the Ethereum Mainnet requires 3TB for a full sync. To reduce the requirement, use [pruning](../../Concepts/Pruning.md). With pruning, we recommend approximately 700GB of available disk space.
