# GraphQL over HTTP

GraphQL can reduce the overhead needed for common queries. For example, instead of querying each receipt in a
block, GraphQL can obtain the same result with a single query for the entire block. 

The GraphQL implementation for Ethereum is described in the [schema](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/blob/master/ethereum/graphql/src/main/resources/schema.graphqls). 
The GraphQL service is enabled using the [command line options](API.md#enabling-api-access).

!!! note
    GraphQL is not supported over WebSockets. 

## GraphQL Requests with Curl 

[Hyperledger Besu JSON-RPC API methods](../../../Reference/API-Methods.md) with an equivalent [GraphQL](GraphQL.md) 
query include a GraphQL request and result in the method example. 

!!! example
    The following [`syncing`](../../../Reference/API-Methods.md#eth_syncing) request returns data about the synchronization status.
    ```bash
    curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data '{ "query": "{syncing{startingBlock currentBlock highestBlock}}"}' http://localhost:8547/graphql
    ```

## GraphQL Requests with GraphiQL App

The third-party tool [GraphiQL](https://github.com/skevy/graphiql-app) provides a tabbed interface for editing and testing GraphQL 
queries and mutations. GraphiQL also provides access the Besu GraphQL schema from within the app.

## Pending  

The Pending query is supported for `transactionCount` and `transactions`. 

!!! important 
    Besu doesn't execute pending transactions so result from `account`, `call`, and `estimateGas` for Pending
    do not reflect pending transactions. 

!!! example
    ```bash tab="Pending Transaction Count"
    curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data '{ "query": "{pending {transactionCount}}"}' http://localhost:8547/graphql
    ```
    
    ```bash tab="Result"
    {
      "data" : {
        "pending" : {
          "transactionCount" : 2
        }
      }
    }
    ```
    
!!! example
    ```bash tab="Pending Transactions"
    curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" --data '{ "query": "{pending {transactions{hash}}}"}' http://localhost:8547/graphql
    ```
        
    ```bash tab="Result"
    {
      "data" : {
        "pending" : {
          "transactions" : [ {
            "hash" : "0xbb3ab8e2113a4afdde9753782cb0680408c0d5b982572dda117a4c72fafbf3fa"
          }, {
            "hash" : "0xf6bd6b1bccf765024bd482a71c6855428e2903895982090ab5dbb0feda717af6"
          } ]
        }
      }
    }
    ```
