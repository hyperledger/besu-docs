# Use metrics to monitor node performance

To enable the [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) monitoring and alerting service to access Hyperledger Besu metrics,
use the [`--metrics-enabled`](../../Reference/CLI/CLI-Syntax.md#metrics-enabled) option.
Use [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) to visualize the collected data.
See the sample [Besu Grafana dashboard](https://grafana.com/dashboards/10273).

The Besu example networks have [monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana configured].

!!! example

    Use Prometheus to monitor the number of blocks your Besu node is behind the chain head, and to alert you that your
    node is not keeping up with the chain head.

    [This recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BuutRe0I28&feature=youtu.be) shows examples of monitoring Hyperledger Besu.

## Install Prometheus

To use Prometheus with Besu, install the [Prometheus main component](https://prometheus.io/download/).
On MacOS, install with [Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/prometheus):

```bash
 brew install prometheus
```

!!! tip

    You can also install:

    * Exporters that send system metrics to Prometheus to monitor non-Besu-specific items such as disk and CPU usage.
    * Other Prometheus components, such as the Alert Manager.
      Additional configuration is not required for these components because Prometheus handles and analyzes data directly
      from the feed.

## Setting up and running Prometheus with Besu

To configure Prometheus and run with Besu:

1. Configure Prometheus to poll Besu.
   For example, add the following YAML fragment to the `scrape_configs` block of the `prometheus.yml` file:

    !!! example

        === "Fragment to insert in prometheus.yml"
   
            ```yml
              - job_name: besu
                scrape_interval: 15s
                scrape_timeout: 10s
                metrics_path: /metrics
                scheme: http
                static_configs:
                - targets:
                  - localhost:9545
            ```
   
        === "Full prometheus.yml example"
   
            ```yml
            global:
              scrape_interval: 15s
    
            scrape_configs:
              - job_name: "prometheus"
                static_configs:
                - targets: ["localhost:9090"]
              - job_name: besu
                scrape_interval: 15s
                scrape_timeout: 10s
                metrics_path: /metrics
                scheme: http
                static_configs:
                - targets:
                  - localhost:9545
            ```
   
        Prometheus requires 3 MB of space per node per hour for metrics, with a `scrape_interval` of 15 seconds.

1. Start Besu with the [`--metrics-enabled`](../../Reference/CLI/CLI-Syntax.md#metrics-enabled) option.
   To start a single node for testing with metrics enabled, run the following command:

    === "Syntax"

        ```bash
        besu --network=dev --miner-enabled --miner-coinbase <COINBASE ADDRESS> --rpc-http-cors-origins="all" --rpc-http-enabled --metrics-enabled
        ```

    === "Example"

        ```bash
        besu --network=dev --miner-enabled --miner-coinbase fe3b557e8fb62b89f4916b721be55ceb828dbd73 --rpc-http-cors-origins="all" --rpc-http-enabled --metrics-enabled
        ```

    To specify the host and port on which Prometheus accesses Besu, use the [`--metrics-host`](../../Reference/CLI/CLI-Syntax.md#metrics-host)
    and [`--metrics-port`](../../Reference/CLI/CLI-Syntax.md#metrics-port) options.
    The default host and port are 127.0.0.1 (`localhost`) and 9545.

    !!! important

        To avoid DNS rebinding attacks, if running Prometheus on a different host than your Besu node (any host other than
        `localhost`), add the hostname that Prometheus uses to [`--host-allowlist`](../../Reference/CLI/CLI-Syntax.md#host-allowlist).

        For example, if Prometheus is configured to get metrics from `http://besu.local:8008/metrics`, then `besu.local`
        has to be in `--host-allowlist`.

1. In another terminal, run Prometheus specifying the `prometheus.yml` file:

    ```bash
    prometheus --config.file=prometheus.yml
    ```

1. View the [Prometheus graphical interface](#view-prometheus-graphical-interface).

    !!! tip

        Use a log ingestion tool, such as Logstash, to parse the logs and alert you to configured anomalies.

## Running Prometheus with Besu in push mode

The [`--metrics-enabled`](../../Reference/CLI/CLI-Syntax.md#metrics-enabled) option enables Prometheus polling of Besu,
but sometimes metrics are hard to poll (for example, when running inside Docker containers with varying IP addresses).
To enable Besu to push metrics to a [Prometheus Pushgateway](https://github.com/prometheus/pushgateway), use the
[`--metrics-push-enabled`](../../Reference/CLI/CLI-Syntax.md#metrics-push-enabled) option.

To configure Prometheus and run with Besu pushing to a push gateway:

1. Configure Prometheus to read from a push gateway.
   For example, add the following YAML fragment to the `scrape_configs` block of the `prometheus.yml` file:

    ```yml
     - job_name: push-gateway
       metrics_path: /metrics
       scheme: http
       static_configs:
       - targets:
         - localhost:9091
    ```

1. Start the push gateway.
   You can deploy the push gateway using the Docker image:

    ```bash
    docker pull prom/pushgateway
    docker run -d -p 9091:9091 prom/pushgateway
    ```

1. Start Besu specifying the `--metrics-push-enabled` option and port of the push gateway:

    === "Syntax"

        ```bash
        besu --network=dev --miner-enabled --miner-coinbase <COINBASE ADDRESS> --rpc-http-cors-origins="all" --rpc-http-enabled --metrics-push-enabled --metrics-push-port=9091 --metrics-push-host=127.0.0.1
        ```

    === "Example"

        ```bash
        besu --network=dev --miner-enabled --miner-coinbase fe3b557e8fb62b89f4916b721be55ceb828dbd73 --rpc-http-cors-origins="all" --rpc-http-enabled --metrics-push-enabled --metrics-push-port=9091 --metrics-push-host=127.0.0.1
        ```

1. In another terminal, run Prometheus specifying the `prometheus.yml` file:

    ```bash
    prometheus --config.file=prometheus.yml
    ```

1. View the [Prometheus graphical interface](#view-prometheus-graphical-interface).

## View Prometheus graphical interface

1. Open a Web browser to [`http://localhost:9090`](http://localhost:9090) to view the Prometheus graphical interface.

1. Choose **Graph** from the menu bar and click the **Console** tab below.

1. From the **Insert metric at cursor** drop-down, select a [metric](#metrics-list) such as `besu_blockchain_difficulty_total`
   or `ethereum_blockchain_height` and click **Execute**.
   The values display.

1. Click the **Graph** tab to view the data as a time-based graph.
   The query string displays below the graph.
   For example, `{ethereum_blockchain_height{instance="localhost:9545",job="prometheus"}`.

### Metrics list

The following table lists available metrics.
Metrics specific to Besu use the `besu_` prefix, and standard Ethereum metrics use the `ethereum_` prefix.
If a metric has a JSON-RPC equivalent, it is included in the definition column.

!!! important

    * The `ethereum_best_known_block_number` metric always has a value. When the
      [`eth_syncing` JSON-RPC method](../../Reference/API-Methods.md#eth_syncing) returns
      false, the current chain height displays.
    * Although the `ethereum_peer_limit` metric does not have a JSON-RPC equivalent, the
      [`max peers` command line option](../../Reference/CLI/CLI-Syntax.md#max-peers) sets the
      maximum number of P2P connections that can be established.
