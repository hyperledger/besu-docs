# Configure Besu for Splunk Enterprise

A Splunk server can receive Besu logs and enable complex search, visualisation and analysis.

Splunk will help you aggregate multiple node logs in one place and run complex queries without the need
to connect to the node machine to read the standard output.

There's 3 ways to run Splunk and Besu:

- [_Splunk connect for Ethereum_ Docker Compose demo](#_splunk-connect-for-ethereum_-docker-compose-demo)
- Splunk Enterprise Docker container
- Standalone Splunk Enterprise

## _Splunk connect for Ethereum_ Docker Compose demo

The _Splunk connect for Ethereum_ demo Docker Compose environment provided by Splunk will help 
you to run a development Besu node and connect it to Splunk Enterprise.

### Requirements

The following tools are required to use the Splunk connect for Ethereum Docker Compose environment.

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Docker and Docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

### Clone the _Splunk connect for Ethereum_ repository

    Open a terminal window and run the following commands:

   ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/splunk/splunk-connect-for-ethereum.git
    cd splunk-connect-for-ethereum
   ``` 

### Run the demo environment

Follow instructions at [Besu example running ethlogger using docker-compose](https://github.com/splunk/splunk-connect-for-ethereum/tree/master/examples/besu).

!!!note

    Splunk enterprise takes some time to start.

    Run the `docker ps` command and wait for the 3 container status to be `Up [number] seconds (healthy)`.
