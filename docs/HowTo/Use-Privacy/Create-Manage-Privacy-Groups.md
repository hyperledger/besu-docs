Hyperledger Besu-extended privacy provides JSON-RPC API methods for creating and managing privacy
groups:

* [`priv_createPrivacyGroup`](../../Reference/API-Methods.md#priv_createprivacygroup)
* [`priv_findPrivacyGroup`](../../Reference/API-Methods.md#priv_findprivacygroup)
* [`priv_deletePrivacyGroup`](../../Reference/API-Methods.md#priv_deleteprivacygroup).

    [EEA-compliant privacy groups](../../Concepts/Privacy/Privacy-Groups.md) using
