# Using onchain privacy groups

Use the [web3.js-eea library](https://github.com/PegaSysEng/web3js-eea) to create and update
membership of [onchain privacy groups](../../Concepts/Privacy/Onchain-PrivacyGroups.md).

!!! important
    [Onchain privacy groups](../../Concepts/Privacy/Onchain-PrivacyGroups.md) are an early access
    feature. Do not use in production networks.

    Onchain privacy groups are not supported with [multi-tenancy](../../Tutorials/Privacy/Configuring-Multi-Tenancy.md).

    The onchain privacy group interfaces may change between releases. There may not be an
    upgrade path from onchain privacy groups created using v1.4 to enable use of onchain privacy
    group functionality in future versions.

    We do not recommend creating onchain privacy groups in a chain with existing
    [offchain privacy groups](../../Concepts/Privacy/Privacy-Groups.md).

## Enabling onchain privacy groups

Use the [`--privacy-onchain-groups-enabled`](../../Reference/CLI/CLI-Syntax.md#privacy-onchain-groups-enabled)
command line option to enable [onchain privacy groups](../../Concepts/Privacy/Onchain-PrivacyGroups.md).
When onchain privacy groups are enabled, the [`priv_createPrivacyGroup`](../../Reference/API-Methods.md#priv_createprivacygroup),
[`priv_deletePrivacyGroup`](../../Reference/API-Methods.md#priv_deleteprivacygroup),
and [`priv_findPrivacyGroup`](../../Reference/API-Methods.md#priv_findprivacygroup) methods for
[offchain privacy groups](../../Concepts/Privacy/Privacy-Groups.md) are disabled.

## Simple onchain privacy group example

To create and find an [onchain privacy group](../../Concepts/Privacy/Onchain-PrivacyGroups.md) using
the [web3.js-eea library](https://github.com/PegaSysEng/web3js-eea):

1. Update the `example/keys.js` file to match your network configuration.

1. Run:

    ```
    node simpleOnChainPrivacy.js
    ```

    This script creates the onchain privacy group with two members. `findPrivacyGroup` finds and
    displays the created privacy group.

!!! tip

    The Orion logs for Orion 1 and Orion 2 displays `PrivacyGroupNotFound` errors. This is expected
    behavior because private transactions check offchain and onchain to find the privacy group for
    a private transaction.

## Adding and removing members

To add and remove members from an [onchain privacy group](../../Concepts/Privacy/Onchain-PrivacyGroups.md),
use the `addToPrivacyGroup` and `removeFromPrivacyGroup` methods in the [web3.js-eea library](https://github.com/PegaSysEng/web3js-eea)
client library.

!!! note

    When adding a member, Besu pushes all existing group transactions to the new member and
    processes them. If there are a large number of existing transactions, adding the member might
    take some time.
