# Using Onchain Privacy Groups

Use the [web3.js-eea library](https://github.com/PegaSysEng/web3js-eea) to create and update
membership of onchain privacy groups.

!!! important
    Onchain privacy groups are an early access feature in v1.4. Do not use in production networks.

    The onchain privacy group interfaces may change between v1.4 and v1.5. There may not be an upgrade
    path from onchain privacy groups created using v1.4 to enable use of onchain privacy group functionality
    in future versions.

    We do not recommend creating onchain privacy groups in a chain with existing
    [offchain privacy groups](../../Concepts/Privacy/Privacy-Groups.md).

## Enabling onchain privacy groups

Use the [`--privacy-onchain-groups-enabled`](../../Reference/CLI/CLI-Syntax.md#privacy-onchain-groups-enabled)
command line option to enable onchain privacy groups. When onchain privacy groups are enabled, the
[`priv_createPrivacyGroup`](../../Reference/API-Methods.md#priv_createprivacygroup),
[`priv_deletePrivacyGroup`](../../Reference/API-Methods.md#priv_deleteprivacygroup),
and [`priv_findPrivacyGroup`](../../Reference/API-Methods.md#priv_findprivacygroup) methods for
[offchain privacy groups](../../Concepts/Privacy/Privacy-Groups.md) are disabled.

## Simple onchain privacy group example

To create and find an onchain privacy group using the [web3.js-eea library](https://github.com/PegaSysEng/web3js-eea):

1. Update the `example/keys.js` file to match your network configuration.
1. Run:

    ```
    node simpleOnChainPrivacy.js
    ```

    The onchain privacy group is created with two members. `findPrivacyGroup` finds and displays the
    created privacy group.

!!! tip
    In the Orion logs for Orion 1 and Orion 2, `PrivacyGroupNotFound` errors are displayed. The errors
    are expected behaviour and occur because private transactions check offchain and onchain to find
    the privacy group for a private transaction.

## Adding and removing members

To add and remove members from an onchain privacy group, use the `addToPrivacyGroup` and
`removeFromPrivayGroup` methods in the [web3.js-eea library](https://github.com/PegaSysEng/web3js-eea)
client library.

!!! note
    When a member is added, all existing group transactions are pushed to the new member and processed.
    If there are a large number of existing transactions, adding the member may take some time.
