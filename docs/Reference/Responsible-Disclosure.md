# Responsible Disclosure Policy

At Hyperledger Besu, security is a priority. But regardless of how much effort we put into system security,
there may still be vulnerabilities present.
If you discover a vulnerability, we want to know about it so we can take steps to address it as 
quickly as possible. We would like to ask you to help us better protect our clients and our systems.
 
Please follow the process explained on [Hyperledger defect response wiki page](https://wiki.hyperledger.org/display/SEC/Defect+Response)
