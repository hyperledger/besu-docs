# Transaction trace types

When using
[`trace_replayBlockTransactions`](API-Methods.md#trace_replayblocktransactions) the
trace options are [`trace`](#trace), [`vmTrace`](#vmtrace), and [`stateDiff`](#statediff).

[`trace_block`](API-Methods.md#trace_block) and [`trace_transaction`](API-Methods.md#trace_transaction)
retrieve only the [`trace`](#trace) option.

## trace

An ordered list of calls to other contracts, excluding precompiled contracts.

!!!example "trace Example"

    ```json
    "trace":[
      {
        "action":{
          "callType":"call",
          "from":"0xfe3b557e8fb62b89f4916b721be55ceb828dbd73",
          "gas":"0xffadea",
          "input":"0x",
          "to":"0x0100000000000000000000000000000000000000",
          "value":"0x0"
        },
        "result":{
          "gasUsed":"0x1e",
          "output":"0x"
        },
        "subtraces":0,
        "traceAddress":[
        ],
        "type":"call"
      }
    ]
    ```

| Key            | Value                                                                          |
|----------------| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `action`       | Transaction details.
| `callType`     | Whether the transaction is `call` or `create`.
| `from`         | Address of the transaction sender.
| `gas`          | Gas provided by sender.
| `input`        | Transaction data.
| `to`           | Target of the transaction.
| `value`        | Value transferred in the transaction.
| `result`       | Transaction result.
| `gasUsed`      | Gas used by the transaction. Includes any refunds of unused gas.
| `output`       | Return value of the contract call. Contains only the actual value sent by a `RETURN` operation. If a `RETURN` was not executed, the output is empty bytes.
| `subTraces`    | Traces of contract calls made by the transaction.
| `traceAddress` | Tree list address of where the call occurred, address of the parents, and order of the current sub call.
| `type`         | Whether the transaction is a `CALL` or `CREATE` series operation.

## vmTrace

An ordered list of EVM actions when processing the transaction.

`vmTrace` only reports actual data returned from a `RETURN` opcode and does not return the
contents of the reserved output space for the call operations. As a result:

* `vmTrace` reports `null` when a call operation ends because of a `STOP`, `HALT`, `REVERT`,
  running out of instructions, or any exceptional halts.
* When a `RETURN` operation returns data of a different length to the space reserved by the call,
  `vmTrace` reports only the data passed to the `RETURN` operation and does not include
  pre-existing memory data or trim the returned data.

For out of gas operations, `vmTrace` reports the operation that caused the out of gas exception,
including the calculated gas cost. `vmTrace` does not report `ex` values because the operation is
not executed.

!!!example "vmTrace Example"

    ```json
    "vmTrace":{
      "code":"0x7f3940be4289e4c3587d88c1856cc95352461992db0a584c281226faefe560b3016000527f14c4d2c102bdeb2354bfc3dc96a95e4512cf3a8461e0560e2272dbf884ef3905601052600851",
      "ops":[
        {
        "cost":3,
        "ex":{
          "mem":null,
          "push":[
            "0x8"
          ],
          "store":null,
          "used":16756175
        },
        "pc":72,
        "sub":null
        },
        ...
      ]
    }
    ```

| Key       | Value                                                                               |
|-----------| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `code`    | Code executed by the EVM.
| `ops`     | Sequence of EVM operations (opcodes) executed in the transaction.
| `cost`    | Gas cost of the opcode. Includes memory expansion costs but not gas refunds. For precompiled contract calls, reports only the actual cost.
| `ex`      | Executed operations.
| `mem`     | Memory read or written by the operation.
| `push`    | Adjusted stack items. For swap, includes all intermediate values and the result. Otherwise, is the value pushed onto the stack.
| `store`   | Account storage written by the operation.
| `used`    | Remaining gas taking into account the all but 1/64th rule for calls.
| `pc`      | Program counter.
| `sub`     | Sub call operations.

## stateDiff

State changes in the requested block for each transaction represented as a map of accounts to an
object. Besu lists the balance, code, nonce, and storage changes from immediately before the
transaction to after the transaction. For the `key:value` pairs:

* `+` indicates the field didnâ€™t exist before and now has the specified value
* `-` indicates a deleted value
* `*` has a from and a to value.

An absent value is distinct from zero when creating accounts or clearing storage.

!!!example "stateDiff Example"

    ```json
    "stateDiff":{
      "0xfe3b557e8fb62b89f4916b721be55ceb828dbd73":{
        "balance":{
          "*":{
            "from":"0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffc3e12a20b",
            "to":"0xffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffffc3dc5f091"
          }
        },
        "code":"=",
        "nonce":{
          "*":{
            "from":"0x14",
            "to":"0x15"
          }
        },
        "storage":{
        }
      }
    }
    ```

| Key            | Value                                                                          |
|-----------     | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `balance`      | Change of balance event.
| `balance.from` | Balance before the transaction.
| `balance.to`   | Balance after the transaction.
| `code`         | Changes to code. None in this example.
| `nonce`        | Change of nonce.
| `nonce.from`   | Nonce before the transaction.
| `nonce.to`     | Nonce after the transaction.
| `storage`      | Changes to storage. None in this example.
