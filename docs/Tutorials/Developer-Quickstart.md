# Developer Quickstart

## Prerequisites

- [Docker and Docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 12 or higher
- On Windows:
    - Windows Subsystem for Linux 2
    - Docker desktop configured to use the WSL2-based engine

!!! important

    Ensure you allow Docker up to 4G of memory or 6G if running the privacy examples.
    Refer to the _Resources_ section in [Docker for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/) and
    [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/) for details.

## Usage

You can follow this [walk-through](https://consensys.net/quorum/products/guides/getting-started-with-consensys-quorum/)
which details the entire process.

To create the docker-compose file and artifacts, run:

```bash
npx quorum-dev-quickstart
```

Follow the prompts displayed.

When installation is complete, refer to `README.md` in the installation directory for more information
on your test network. Optionally, refer to the previously mentioned walk-through.

## Private transactions

At the prompt **Do you wish to enable support for private transactions?**, enter `Y` to get three Besu nodes, with each
node having a corresponding Tessera node for privacy. You can access the Besu member nodes for API calls and
transactions.

Follow the [privacy walk-through](./Examples/Privacy-Example.md) which details how to send private
transactions, and interact with deployed private contracts.

## Monitoring

At the prompt **Do you wish to enable support for logging with Splunk or ELK?**, choose **None** to use only the default
monitoring tools, [Prometheus and Grafana](../HowTo/Monitor/Metrics.md), which let you visualize node health and usage.
The [quickstart tutorial](Examples/Private-Network-Example.md#monitor-nodes-with-prometheus-and-grafana) contains Prometheus
and Grafana usage and configuration information.

Choose **Splunk** to use the default monitoring tools and [Splunk monitoring](../HowTo/Monitor/Splunk-Enterprise.md).

Choose **ELK** to use the default monitoring tools and [ELK logging](../HowTo/Monitor/Elastic-Stack.md).

### Block explorer

The quickstart supports the [BlockScout](https://github.com/blockscout/blockscout) block explorer.
Access BlockScout at [`http://localhost:26000`](http://localhost:26000).

!!! note

    BlockScout's Docker image is resource heavy when running.
    Ensure you have adequate CPU resources dedicated to the container.

To start BlockScout, run the following command after the quickstart is already running:

```bash
./run-blockscout.sh
```

The [quickstart BlockScout configuration](https://github.com/ConsenSys/quorum-dev-quickstart/blob/master/templates/goquorum/docker-compose.blockscout.yml)
is available as a reference for your own network.

## Smart contracts and dapps

You can use the Pet Shop demo dapp provided by [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/tutorial) which runs
a local website using Docker, and uses smart contracts deployed on the network.

The directory created by `quorum-dev-quickstart` includes a `dapps/pet-shop` directory which contains
the source code for the dapp, including the smart contracts, website, and configurations to run
the tutorial.

Follow the [dapp walk-through](Examples/Private-Network-Example.md#smart-contract-and-dapp-usage) which details
how to deploy the dapp and interact with the network.

## Add a new node to the network

New nodes joining an existing network require the following:

- The same genesis file used by all other nodes on the running network.
- A list of nodes to connect to; this is done by specifying [bootnodes], or by providing a list of [static nodes].
- A node key pair and optionally an account. If the running network is using permissions, then you need
  to add the new node's enode details to the [permissions file] used by existing nodes, or update
  the onchain permissioning contract.

The following steps describe the process to add a new node to the Developer Quickstart.

### 1. Create the node key files

Create a node key pair and account for a new node by running the following script:

```bash
cd ./extra
npm install
node generate_node_keys.js --password "Password"
```

!!! note

    The `--password` parameter is optional.

### 2. Create new node directory

Navigate to the directory where the configuration files for the network were created.

!!! note

    The directory was specified in an earlier step when running `npx quorum-dev-quickstart`. The default
    location is `./quorum-test-network`.

In the `config/nodes` directory, create a subdirectory for the new node (for example, `newnode`), and move the
`nodekey`, `nodekey.pub`, `address` and `accountkey` files from the previous step into this directory.

### 3. Update docker-compose

Add an entry for the new node into the docker-compose file:

```yaml
  newnode:
    <<: *besu-def
    container_name: newnode
    volumes:
      - public-keys:/opt/besu/public-keys/
      - ./config/besu/:/config
      - ./config/nodes/newnode:/opt/besu/keys
      - ./logs/besu:/tmp/besu
    depends_on:
      - validator1
    networks:
      quorum-dev-quickstart:
        ipv4_address: 172.16.239.41
```

!!! important

    Select an IP address and port map not being used for the other containers. Additionally mount the newly created
    folder `./config/nodes/newnode` to the `/opt/besu/keys` directory of the new node, as seen in the example above.

### 4. Update Prometheus configuration

Update `prometheus.yml` in the `./config/prometheus/` directory to configure metrics to display in Grafana.

Insert the following under `scrape_configs` section in the file. Ensure you change `job_name` and `targets`
appropriately if you've updated them.

```yaml
- job_name: newnode
  scrape_interval: 15s
  scrape_timeout: 10s
  metrics_path: /metrics
  scheme: http
  static_configs:
    - targets: [newnode:9545]
```

### 5. Update files with the enode address

Add the new node's enode address to the [static nodes] file and [permissions file].
The enode uses the format `enode://pubkey@ip_address:30303`.
If the `nodekey.pub` is `4540ea...9c1d78` and the IP address is `172.16.239.41`, then the enode
address would be `"enode://4540ea...9c1d78@172.16.239.41:30303"`,
which must be added to both files.

Alternatively, call the
[`perm_addNodesToAllowlist`](https://besu.hyperledger.org/en/latest/Reference/API-Methods/#perm_addnodestoallowlist)
API method on existing nodes to add the new node without requiring a restart.

!!! note

    Please note that calling the API method by itself will only persist for as long as the nodes remain online
    and will be lost on next restart.

    On a live network, the new node must be added to the [permissions file] so that subsequent restarts
    of the nodes are aware of the change.

### 6. Start the network

Once complete, start the network up with `./run.sh`.
When using the smart contract you can either make changes via a [dapp](https://github.com/ConsenSys/permissioning-smart-contracts) or via RPC
[API] calls.
