# Developer Quickstart

## Prerequisites

- [Docker and Docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 12 or higher
- On Windows:
    - Windows Subsystem for Linux 2
    - Docker desktop configured to use the WSL2-based engine

!!! important
    Ensure you allow Docker up to 4G of memory or 6G if running the privacy examples.
    Refer to the _Resources_ section in [Docker for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/) and
    [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/) for details.

## Usage

You can follow this [walk-through](https://consensys.net/quorum/products/guides/getting-started-with-consensys-quorum/)
which details the entire process.

To create the docker-compose file and artifacts, run:

```bash
npx quorum-dev-quickstart
```

Follow the prompts displayed.

When installation is complete, refer to `README.md` in the installation directory for more information
on your test network. Optionally, refer to the previously mentioned walk-through.

## Private transactions

At the prompt **Do you wish to enable support for private transactions?**, enter `Y` to get three Besu nodes, with each
node having a corresponding Tessera node for privacy. You can access the Besu member nodes for API calls and
transactions.

Follow the [privacy walk-through](./Examples/Privacy-Example.md) which details how to send private
transactions, and interact with deployed private contracts.

## Monitoring

At the prompt **Do you wish to enable support for logging with Splunk or ELK?**, choose **None** to use only the default
monitoring tools, [Prometheus and Grafana](../HowTo/Monitor/Metrics.md), which let you visualize node health and usage.
The [quickstart tutorial](Examples/Private-Network-Example.md#monitor-nodes-with-prometheus-and-grafana) contains Prometheus
and Grafana usage and configuration information.

Choose **Splunk** to use the default monitoring tools and [Splunk monitoring](../HowTo/Monitor/Splunk-Enterprise.md).

Choose **ELK** to use the default monitoring tools and [ELK logging](../HowTo/Monitor/Elastic-Stack.md).

### Block explorer

The quickstart supports the [BlockScout](https://github.com/blockscout/blockscout) block explorer.
Access BlockScout at [`http://localhost:26000`](http://localhost:26000).

!!! note

    BlockScout's Docker image is resource heavy when running.
    Ensure you have adequate CPU resources dedicated to the container.

To start BlockScout, run the following command after the quickstart is already running:

```bash
./run-blockscout.sh
```

The [quickstart BlockScout configuration](https://github.com/ConsenSys/quorum-dev-quickstart/blob/master/templates/goquorum/docker-compose.blockscout.yml)
is available as a reference for your own network.

## Smart contracts and dapps

You can use the Pet Shop demo dapp provided by [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/tutorial) which runs
a local website using Docker, and uses smart contracts deployed on the network.

The directory created by `quorum-dev-quickstart` includes a `dapps/pet-shop` directory which contains
the source code for the dapp, including the smart contracts, website, and configurations to run
the tutorial.

Follow the [dapp walk-through](Examples/Private-Network-Example.md#smart-contract-and-dapp-usage) which details
how to deploy the dapp and interact with the network.
