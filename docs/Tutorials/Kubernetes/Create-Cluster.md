# Create a cluster

Create a cluster before you deploy the network, there are options locally and in cloud.

## Prerequisites

* Clone the [Quorum-Kubernetes](https://github.com/ConsenSys/quorum-kubernetes) repository
* Install [Kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)
* Install [Helm3](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)
* Install [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) and [`eksctl`](https://eksctl.io/) for AWS EKS clusters
* Install [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) for Azure AKS clusters
* Install the cloud-specific CLI

## Local Clusters

Use one of several options to create a local cluster. Select one listed below, or another that you
are comfortable with.

### Minikube

[Minikube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/) is one of the most popular options to spin up a
local Kubernetes cluster for development. You can [install a version](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/)
based on your architecture.

!!! note
    We recommend at least 2 CPUs and 16GB of RAM.

To start the cluster, run the following command:

```bash
minikube start --cpus 2 --memory 16384 --cni auto
```

### kind

[kind (Kubernetes in Docker)](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io) is a lightweight tool for running local Kubernetes clusters. The
[installation](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start#installation) is similar to [Minikube](#minikube).

To start the cluster, run the following command:

```bash
kind create cluster
```

### Rancher

[Rancher](https://github.com/rancher-sandbox/rancher-desktop/) is a light-weight open source desktop application
for Mac, Windows and Linux. It provides Kubernetes and container management, and allows you to choose the
version of Kubernetes to run.

It can build, push, pull and run container images. Built container images can be run without needing a registry.

!!!note
    The official Docker-CLI is not supported but rather uses [nerdctl](https://github.com/containerd/nerdctl) which is
    a Docker-CLI compatible tool for containerd, and is automatically installed with Rancher Desktop.

!!!note
    For Windows, you need to [install Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)
    to install Rancher Desktop.

Refer to the [official documentation](https://github.com/rancher-sandbox/docs.rancherdesktop.io/blob/main/docs/installation.md)
for system requirements and installation instructions.

## Cloud Clusters

### AWS EKS

[AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (AWS EKS)](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/) is one of the most popular platforms
to deploy Hyperledger Besu.

To create a cluster in AWS, you need to install the [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) and
[`eksctl`](https://eksctl.io/).

The [template](https://github.com/ConsenSys/quorum-kubernetes/tree/master/aws) comprises the base
infrastructure used to build the cluster and other resources in AWS. We also use AWS native
services and features after the cluster is created. These include:

* [Pod identities](https://github.com/aws/amazon-eks-pod-identity-webhook)
* [Secrets Store CSI drivers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/ebs-csi.html)
* Dynamic storage classes backed by AWS EBS. The
    [volume claims](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#persistentvolumeclaims) are fixed
    sizes and can be updated as you grow via helm updates, and will not need to re-provision the underlying storage
    class.
* [CNI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/pod-networking.html) networking mode for EKS. By default,
    EKS clusters use `kubenet` to create a virtual network and subnet. Nodes get an IP
    address from a virtual network subnet. Network address translation (NAT) is then configured on the nodes, and pods
    receive an IP address "hidden" behind the node IP.

    !!! note
        This approach reduces the number of IP addresses that you need
        to reserve in your network space for pods, but places constraints on what can connect to the nodes from
        outside the cluster (for example on premises nodes or those on another cloud provider).

AWS Container Networking Interface (CNI) provides each pod with an IP address from the subnet, and can be accessed
directly. The IP addresses must be unique across your network space, and must be planned in advance. Each node has
a configuration parameter for the maximum number of pods that it supports. The equivalent number of IP addresses
per node are then reserved up front for that node. This approach requires more planning, and can lead to IP address
exhaustion as your application demands grow, however makes it easier for external nodes to connect to your cluster.

!!!warning

    EKS clusters may not use 169.254.0.0/16, 172.30.0.0/16, 172.31.0.0/16, or 192.0.2.0/24 for the Kubernetes
    service address range.

To provision the cluster:

1. Update [cluster.yml](https://github.com/ConsenSys/quorum-kubernetes/blob/master/aws/templates/cluster.yml) with
your VPC details.

1. Deploy the template:

    ```bash
    eksctl create cluster -f ./templates/cluster.yml
    ```

1. Optionally, deploy the
[kubernetes dashboard](https://github.com/ConsenSys/quorum-kubernetes/tree/master/aws/templates/k8s-dashboard)

1. Provision the drivers. After the deployment completes, provision the secrets manager, identity, and
CSI drivers. Use `besu` for `EKS_NAMESPACE` and update `AWS_REGION` and `EKS_CLUSTER_NAME` in the
commands below to match your settings from step 2.

    ```bash
    helm repo add secrets-store-csi-driver https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kubernetes-sigs/secrets-store-csi-driver/master/charts
    helm install --namespace besu --create-namespace csi-secrets-store secrets-store-csi-driver/secrets-store-csi-driver
    kubectl apply --namespace besu -f templates/secrets-manager/aws-provider-installer.yml

    POLICY_ARN=$(aws --region AWS_REGION --query Policy.Arn --output text iam create-policy --policy-name besu-node-secrets-mgr-policy --policy-document '{
        "Version": "2012-10-17",
        "Statement": [ {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": ["secretsmanager:CreateSecret","secretsmanager:UpdateSecret","secretsmanager:DescribeSecret","secretsmanager:GetSecretValue","secretsmanager:PutSecretValue","secretsmanager:ReplicateSecretToRegions","secretsmanager:TagResource"],
            "Resource": ["arn:aws:secretsmanager:AWS_REGION:AWS_ACCOUNT:secret:besu-node-*"]
        } ]
    }')

    eksctl create iamserviceaccount --name besu-node-secrets-sa --namespace EKS_NAMESPACE --region=AWS_REGION --cluster EKS_CLUSTER_NAME --attach-policy-arn "$POLICY_ARN" --approve --override-existing-serviceaccounts
    ```

1. You can now use your cluster and you can deploy [Helm charts](./Deploy-Charts.md) to it.

### [Azure AKS](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-au/services/kubernetes-service/)

Azure Kubernetes Service is also a popular cloud platform that you can use to deploy Besu. To create a cluster in
Azure, you need to install the [Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) and you
must have admin rights on your Azure subscription to enable some preview features on AKS.

The [template](https://github.com/ConsenSys/quorum-kubernetes/tree/master/azure) comprises the base
infrastructure used to build the cluster and other resources in Azure. We also make use Azure native
services and features after the cluster is created. These include:

* [AAD pod identities](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/use-azure-ad-pod-identity).
* [Secrets Store CSI drivers](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/key-vault-integrate-kubernetes)
* Dynamic storage classes backed by Azure Files. The
    [volume claims](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/azure-disks-dynamic-pv) are fixed sizes and can be updated
    as you grow via helm updates, and will not need to re-provision the underlying storage class.
* [CNI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/configure-azure-cni) networking mode for AKS. By default, AKS
    clusters use `kubenet`, to create a virtual network and subnet. Nodes get an IP address
    from a virtual network subnet. Network address translation (NAT) is then configured on the nodes, and pods receive
    an IP address "hidden" behind the node IP.

    !!! note
        This approach reduces the number of IP addresses that you need to reserve
        in your network space for pods to use, however places constraints on what can connect to the nodes from outside the
        cluster (for example on prem nodes or other cloud providers)

AKS Container Networking Interface (CNI) provides each pod with an IP address from the subnet, and can be accessed
directly. These IP addresses must be unique across your network space, and must be planned in advance. Each node has
a configuration parameter for the maximum number of pods that it supports. The equivalent number of IP addresses
per node are then reserved up front for that node. This approach requires more planning, and can leads to IP address
exhaustion as your application demands grow, however makes it easier for external nodes to connect to your cluster.

!!!warning

    Please do not create more than one AKS cluster in the same subnet. AKS clusters may not use 169.254.0.0/16,
    172.30.0.0/16, 172.31.0.0/16, or 192.0.2.0/24 for the Kubernetes service address range.

To provision the cluster:

1. Enable the preview features that allow you to use AKS with CNI, and a managed identity to authenticate and
    run cluster operations with other services. We also enable
    [AAD pod identities](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/use-azure-ad-pod-identity) which use the managed
    identity. This is in preview so you need to enable this feature by registering the `EnablePodIdentityPreview` feature:

    ```bash
    az feature register --name EnablePodIdentityPreview --namespace Microsoft.ContainerService
    ```

    This takes a little while and you can check on progress by running:

    ```bash
    az feature list --namespace Microsoft.ContainerService -o table
    ```

    Install or update your local Azure CLI with preview features:

    ```bash
    az extension add --name aks-preview
    az extension update --name aks-preview
    ```

1. Create a resource group if you don't already have one:

    ```bash
    az group create --name BesuGroup --location "East US"
    ```

1. Deploy the template:

    1. Navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), select **+ Create a resource** in the upper left corner.
    1. Search for `Template deployment (deploy using custom templates)` and select **Create**.
    1. Select **Build your own template in the editor**.
    1. Remove the contents (JSON) in the editor and paste in the contents of
      [`azuredeploy.json`](https://github.com/ConsenSys/quorum-kubernetes/blob/master/azure/arm/azuredeploy.json)
    1. Select **Save**.
    1. Input provisioning parameters in the displayed user interface.

1. Provision the drivers:
    1. Run the [bootstrap](https://github.com/ConsenSys/quorum-kubernetes/blob/master/azure/scripts/bootstrap.sh) script.
    1. Use `besu` for `AKS_NAMESPACE`, and update `AKS_RESOURCE_GROUP`, `AKS_CLUSTER_NAME`, and `AKS_MANAGED_IDENTITY`
        in the commands below to match your settings and deployed resources from step 3.

        ```bash
        ./scripts/bootstrap.sh "AKS_RESOURCE_GROUP" "AKS_CLUSTER_NAME" "AKS_MANAGED_IDENTITY" "AKS_NAMESPACE"
        ```

1. You can now use your cluster and you can deploy [Helm charts](./Deploy-Charts.md) to it.
