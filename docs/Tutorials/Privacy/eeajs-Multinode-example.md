# Using Multinode Example in web3.js-eea Client Library

To use the examples provided in EEA JS library with [your privacy network](Configuring-Privacy.md):

1. Clone the **PegaSysEng/eeajs** repository: 
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/PegaSysEng/eeajs.git
     ```

1. In the `eeajs` directory: 
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

1. In the `example` directory, update the `keys.js` file to include:
    * Orion node public keys 
    * Hyperledger Besu node RPC URLs 
    * Hyperledger Besu node private keys 

1. If the `chainID` specified in the genesis file for your network is not `2018`, update `deployContract.js`, 
`storeValueFromNode1.js`, and `storeValueFromNode2.js` to specify your chain ID instead of `2018`. 

1. In the `example/multiNodeExample` directory, deploy the contract: 
   ```bash
   node deployContract.js
   ```

    A private transaction receipt is returned.

      logs: [] } 
    ```   
   
1. Copy the contract address from the private transaction receipt and set the `CONTRACT_ADDRESS` environment variable: 
   
    ```bash
    export CONTRACT_ADDRESS=<Contract Address from Private Transaction Receipt>
    ```

    !!! example
        ```bash
        export CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0xfee84481da8f4b9a998dfacb38091b3145bb01ab 
        ```
   
1. Store a value in the contract from Node 1: 
    ```bash
    node storeValueFromNode1.js
    ```
   
    The value of 1000 (3e8 in hex) is stored by Node 1 and is visible to Node 1 and Node 2. 
   
    ```bash
    Transaction Hash: 0xd9d71cc6f64675e1a48183ded8f08930af317eb883ebae4c4eec66ae68618d85

    ```

7. Store a value in the contract from Node 2: 
    ```bash
    node storeValueFromNode2.js
    ```
      
    The value of 42 (2a in hex) is stored by Node 1 and is visible to Node 1 and Node 2. 
      
    ```bash
    Transaction Hash: 0xa025433aec47a71b0230f12f43708812fd38ff7b7c1dc89a715f71dcbd5fbdbf

    Waiting for transaction to be mined ...
    Get Value from http://localhost:8547: 0x
    ```

    !!! note
        The Node 3 Orion log messages indicate payloads cannot be found. This is expected behaviour
        because Node 3 does not have access to the private transactions between Node 1 and Node 2.
