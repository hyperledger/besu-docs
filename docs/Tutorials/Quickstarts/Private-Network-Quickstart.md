# Private Network Quickstart Tutorial

The Private Network Quickstart uses the Hyperledger Besu Docker image to run a private network of
Besu nodes managed by Docker Compose.

!!! important 
    The Private Network Quickstart runs a private network suitable for education or demonstration purposes. 
    The Private Network Quickstart is not intended for running production networks. 

## Prerequisites

To run this tutorial, you must have the following installed:

- MacOS or Linux 
    
    !!! important 
        The Private Network Quickstart is not supported on Windows. If using Windows, run the quickstart
        inside a Linux VM such as Ubuntu. 

- [Docker and Docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) 

    !!! important 
        If using MacOS, enable Docker to use up to 4GB of memory on the [_Advanced_ tab in _Preferences_](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/).  

- [Git command line](https://git-scm.com/)

- [Curl command line](https://curl.haxx.se/download.html) 

- A web browser that supports [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) (currently Chrome, Firefox, Opera, and Brave), and has 
the MetaMask plug-in installed. This tutorial uses screenshots from Brave.


## Clone Besu Quickstart Source Code

Clone the repository from the `besu-quickstart` repository:

```bash tab="Linux/MacOS"
git clone https://github.com/PegaSysEng/besu-quickstart.git
```

!!!note
    Download a specific release at https://github.com/PegaSysEng/besu-quickstart/releases.

## Start Services and Network
 
This tutorial uses [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) to assemble the images and 
run the private network. To build the docker images and run the containers, go to the `besu-quickstart` directory and run:

```bash tab="Linux/MacOS"
./run.sh
```

The `run.sh` script builds the images, and runs the containers. It also scales the regular node 
container to four containers to simulate a network with enough peers to synchronize.

When the process ends, it lists the running services:

Followed by a list of the endpoints:

!!! example "Endpoint list example"
    ```log
    ****************************************************************
    JSON-RPC HTTP service endpoint      : http://localhost:8545
    JSON-RPC WebSocket service endpoint : ws://localhost:8546
    GraphQL HTTP service endpoint       : http://localhost:8547
    Web block explorer address          : http://localhost:32768/
    Prometheus address                  : http://localhost:9090/graph
    Grafana address                     : http://localhost:3000/d/XE4V0WGZz/besu-overview?orgId=1&refresh=10s&from=now-30m&to=now&var-system=All
    Kibana logs address                 : http://localhost:5601/app/kibana#/discover
    ****************************************************************
    ```

- Use the **JSON-RPC HTTP service endpoint** to access the RPC node service from your Dapp or from cryptocurrency
wallets such as Metamask.
- Use the **JSON-RPC WebSocket service endpoint** to access the web socket node service from your Dapp.
- Use the **GraphQL HTTP service endpoint** to access the [HTTP GraphQL](../../HowTo/Interact/APIs/GraphQL.md) node service from your Dapp.
- Use the **Web block explorer address** to display the block explorer web application. View the block explorer by
entering the URL in your web browser.
- Use the **Prometheus address** to access the [Prometheus dashboard](../../HowTo/Monitor/Metrics.md).
- Use the **Grafana address** to access the [Grafana dashboard](../../HowTo/Monitor/Metrics.md).
- Use the **Kibana logs address** to access the [logs in Kibana](../../HowTo/Monitor/Elastic-Stack.md). 

To display the list of endpoints again, run:

```bash tab="Linux/MacOS"
./list.sh
```

## Block Explorer

This tutorial uses the [Alethio Ethereum Lite Explorer](https://lite-explorer.aleth.io/).

### Run the Block Explorer

Access the explorer by copying and pasting the `Web block explorer address` displayed when starting the private network
to your browser.

The block explorer displays a summary of the private network:

![Block Explorer](../../images/ExplorerSummary.png)

Notice that the explorer indicates 6 peers: the 4 regular nodes, the mining node and the bootnode.

Click the block number to the right of **Best Block** to display the block details:

![Block Details](../../images/ExplorerBlockDetails.png)

You can explore blocks by clicking on the blocks under **Bk** on the left-hand side.

You can search for a specific block, transaction hash, or address by clicking the magnifying glass in the top left-hand corner.

![Explorer Search](../../images/ExplorerSearch.png)


## Monitoring nodes with Prometheus and Grafana

The quickstart also includes Prometheus and Grafana monitoring tools to let you visualise the nodes 
health and usage. You can directly access these tools from your browser at the addresses displayed 
in the endpoint list.

For more details on how to configure and use these tools for your own nodes, refer to our 
[performances monitoring documentation](../../HowTo/Monitor/Metrics.md), 
as well as [Prometheus documentation](https://prometheus.io/docs/introduction/overview/)
and [Grafana documentation](https://grafana.com/docs/).

![Grafana](../../images/grafana.png)

## Run JSON-RPC Requests 

You can run RPC requests on `rpcnode`, the node exposed to the host in order to listen for requests. This tutorial uses 
[cURL](https://curl.haxx.se/download.html) to make JSON-RPC requests.

For the RPC URL, this tutorial uses the placeholder `<http-rpc-endpoint>`. When you run the tutorial, 
replace this placeholder with the JSON-RPC HTTP service endpoint provided when you list the endpoints. (For example,
`http://localhost:32770/jsonrpc`.) The dynamic docker port mapping changes each time you run the network.

{!global/Postman.md!}

### Requesting the Node Version

Run the following command from the host shell:

```bash
curl -X POST --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"web3_clientVersion","params":[],"id":1}' <http-rpc-endpoint>
```

The result specifies the client version: 

```json
{
   "jsonrpc" : "2.0",
   "id" : 1,
   "result" : "besu/<version number>"
}
```
Here we simply query the version of the Besu node, which confirms the node is running.

Successfully calling this method shows that you can connect to the nodes via RPC. From here, you can walk through more 
interesting requests demonstrated in the rest of this section, or skip ahead to 
[Creating a Transaction Using MetaMask](#creating-a-transaction-using-metamask).

### Counting Peers

Peers are the number of other nodes connected to the RPC node.

Poll the peer count using `net_peerCount`:

```bash
curl -X POST --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"net_peerCount","params":[],"id":1}' <http-rpc-endpoint>
```

The result indicates that there are 6 peers:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc" : "2.0",
  "id" : 1,
  "result" : "0x6"
}
```

### Requesting the Most Recently Mined Block Number  

Call `eth_blockNumber` to retrieve the number of the most recent block:

```bash
curl -X POST --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_blockNumber","params":[],"id":1}' <http-rpc-endpoint>
```

The result provides the most recently mined block:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc" : "2.0",
  "id" : 1,
  "result" : "0x8b8"
}
```

The hexadecimal value `0x8b8` translates to `2232` in decimal, the number of blocks that have been mined so far.

### Checking the Miner Account Balance 

Call `eth_getBalance` to retrieve the balance of the mining address (coinbase) defined in the miner node:

```bash
curl -X POST --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"eth_getBalance","params":["0xfe3b557e8fb62b89f4916b721be55ceb828dbd73","latest"],"id":1}' <http-rpc-endpoint>
```

The result specifies the miner account balance:

```json
{
  "jsonrpc" : "2.0",
  "id" : 1,
  "result" : "0x79f905c6fd34e80000"
}
```

!!!info
    0x79f905c6fd34e80000 = 2250000000000000000000 Wei (2250 Ether).
!!!tip
    Use a [unit converter](https://www.etherchain.org/tools/unitConverter) to easily translate values from Wei to Ether.

Wait several seconds until new blocks are mined and call `eth_getBalance` again. The balance increases, meaning the miner
address successfully received the mining reward.

You can also view this information in the block explorer. It does exactly the same thing as this call, connecting
to the RPC node using HTTP JSON-RPC, and displaying information on a web page.


## Creating a Transaction Using MetaMask

Now let's use [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) to send transactions.

Before sending transactions, you need to create an account or use one of the accounts below created during the genesis
of this private test network.

{!global/test_accounts.md!}

!!!note
    Besu doesn't implement [account management](../../HowTo/Send-Transactions/Account-Management.md). To create your own account, 
    you have to use a third-party tool such as MetaMask.

After you sign in to MetaMask, connect to the private network RPC endpoint:

1. In the MetaMask network list, select **Custom RPC**.
1. In the **New RPC URL** field, enter the JSON-RPC HTTP service endpoint displayed when you started the private network.

Save the configuration and return to the MetaMask main screen. Your current network is now set to the private network RPC node.

[Import one of the existing accounts above into MetaMask](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015489331-Importing-an-Account-New-UI-)
using the corresponding private key.

!!!note
    In this tutorial, we don't need to secure the keys, because we're using a private test network to send valueless 
    Ether. However, be sure to secure your accounts in a real use case on the main Ethereum network (MainNet).

Once this is done, [create another account from scratch](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015289452-Creating-Additional-MetaMask-Wallets-New-UI-)
to send Ether to.

In MetaMask, select the new account and copy the account address by clicking the **...** gadget and selecting 
**Copy Address to clipboard**.

In the block explorer, search for the new account by clicking on the magnifying glass and pasting the account address
into the search box. The account is displayed with a zero balance. 

[Send Ether](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015488991-Sending-Ether-New-UI-) from the first account 
(containing ether) to the new one (which has a zero balance).

Refresh the browser page that displays the new account. The updated balance is displayed and reflects the transaction
completed using MetaMask.


## Smart Contract and DApp Usage with the blockchain network

We are going to use the [PetShop tutorial on Truffle website](https://truffleframework.com/tutorials/pet-shop) with a 
few modifications, so we use the private network in this tutorial as the blockchain network. 


#### Prerequisites

* [Node.js v6+ LTS and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/) (comes with Node)

* Import an account into Metamask using the private key `0xc87509a1c067bbde78beb793e6fa76530b6382a4c0241e5e4a9ec0a0f44dc0d3`. 
The following steps use this account.
    

#### Install Truffle 

Install Truffle :

```bash
npm install -g truffle
```

!!! note
    `npm` requires `sudo` on Linux.
    

The source code for the smart contract and DApp are in the `pet-shop` folder. With the blockchain running and Metamask 
connected to it via the browser, run the command below to start the DApp. 

The script first compiles the contract, then performs a migration to the blockchain network and then runs some tests. 
You can then search for the deployed contracts and transactions in the Web Block Explorer using the addresses displayed 
in your output earlier ```http://localhost:32768/``` (your port will differ)
Output similar to the following is displayed (your addresses will differ)

!!! example
     ```bash tab="Linux/MacOS command"
     ./run-dapp.sh
     ```

    ```log tab="dapp result"

Once these tests are successful, it builds a container for the Pet Shop DApp and deployes it, binding it to port 3001 on your machine. 

In the browser that you have metamask enabled and the account loaded, open a new tab and navigate to `http://localhost:3001` which should have the Pet Shop running, and you can adopt 
pets from the app. When you click on 'Adopt', a Metamask window should pop up and ask for permissions to continue with the transaction.
Once complete and successful, the status of the pet you adopted will show 'Success'. 

![Dapp UI](../../images/dapp-ui.png)
 
You can also search for the transaction and view its details in the Block Explorer UI 

![Dapp UI](../../images/dapp-explorer-tx.png)
 
Additionally, the Metmask UI also keeps a record of the transaction 

![Dapp UI](../../images/dapp-metamask-tx.png)
 

and you'll be able to see the 
transactions in the block explorer as well as the Metmask UI.



## Stop / Restart Private Network without Removing Containers 

To shut down the private network without deleting the containers:

```bash tab="Linux/MacOS"
./stop.sh
```

This command stops the containers related to the services specified in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

To restart the private network:

```bash tab="Linux/MacOS"
./resume.sh
```

## Stop Private Network and Remove Containers

To shut down the private network and delete all containers and images created during the quickstart:

```bash tab="Linux/MacOS"
./remove.sh
```
