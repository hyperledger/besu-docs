# Besu Enterprise Ethereum Client

## What is Hyperledger Besu?

Hyperledger Besu is an open-source Ethereum client developed under the Apache 2.0 license and
written in Java. It runs on the Ethereum public network, private networks, and test networks such
as Rinkeby, Ropsten, and GÃ¶rli. Besu implements Proof of Work (Ethash) and Proof of Authority (IBFT
2.0 and Clique) consensus mechanisms.

You can use Besu to develop enterprise applications requiring secure, high-performance transaction
processing in a private network.

Besu supports enterprise features including privacy and permissioning.

## What can you do with Besu?

Besu includes a [command line interface](Reference/CLI/CLI-Syntax.md) and
[JSON-RPC API](HowTo/Interact/APIs/API.md) for running, maintaining, debugging, and monitoring
nodes in an Ethereum network. You can use the API via RPC over HTTP or via WebSockets. Besu also
supports Pub/Sub. The API supports typical Ethereum functionalities such as:

* Ether mining
* Smart contract development
* Decentralized application (Dapp) development.

## New to Enterprise Ethereum?

Get started with the [Developer Quickstart](Tutorials/Developer-Quickstart.md). Use the quickstart
to rapidly generate local blockchain networks.

## What does Besu support?

The Besu client supports common smart contract and Dapp development, deployment, and operational
use cases, using tools such as [Truffle](http://truffleframework.com/),
[Remix](https://github.com/ethereum/remix), and [web3j](https://web3j.io/). The client supports
common JSON-RPC API methods such as `eth`, `net`, `web3`, `debug`, and `miner`.

Besu doesn't support [key management](HowTo/Send-Transactions/Account-Management.md) inside the
client. You can use [EthSigner](http://docs.ethsigner.pegasys.tech/en/latest/) with Besu to access
your key store and sign transactions.
