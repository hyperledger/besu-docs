# Plugin lifecycle

TO DO: This page should contain an explanation of the plugin lifecycle.
It can include a diagram of the lifecycle.
It might take
[this plugin lifecycle overview](https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=shared&t=919&v=78sa2WuA1rg)
as a starting point, with updates as needed.

This page should also explain "hooks," and how they can alter the lifecycle events within Besu.
