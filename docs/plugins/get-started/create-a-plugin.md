# Create a simple plugin

TO DO: This page should contain a step-by-step tutorial on creating a minimal
plugin for a basic use case.

The goal is to teach the user the essential workflow and components of any
plugin (e.g., lifecycle events, configuration, using the API, deployment, see
results) so they can get started quickly on their specific use case.

This tutorial can link to other pages that go into more detail about each step,
and also link to more advanced next steps / use cases.
