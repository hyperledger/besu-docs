# Create and send transactions

In private networks, you can create and [send regular transactions](../../../public-networks/how-to/send-transactions.md) as in public networks.

You can also:

- [Include revert reason in transactions](revert-reason.md).
- [Replace transactions in the transaction pool](../../../public-networks/concepts/transactions/pool.md#in-networks-with-zero-base-base-or-free-gas).
