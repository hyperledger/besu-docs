# Connect to a testnet

Run Besu as an [execution client](../../concepts/the-merge.md#execution-clients) with any consensus client on the [Holesky](https://github.com/eth-clients/holesky) and [Sepolia](https://github.com/eth-clients/sepolia) testnets.

If you're using [Teku](https://docs.teku.consensys.net/en/latest/) as a consensus client, you can follow the [Besu and Teku testnet tutorial](../../tutorials/besu-teku-testnet.md).

:::note

Sepolia is a permissioned network and you can't run a validator client on it without [requesting to become a validator](https://notes.ethereum.org/zvkfSmYnT0-uxwwEegbCqg) first. You can connect your consensus client using the beacon node only, without any validator duties.

:::

## Prerequisites

- [Besu installed](../install/binary-distribution.md).
- A consensus client installed. For example, [Teku](https://docs.teku.consensys.net/en/latest/).

## Steps

### 1. Generate the shared secret

Run the following command:

```bash
openssl rand -hex 32 | tr -d "\n" > jwtsecret.hex
```

You will specify `jwtsecret.hex` when starting Besu and the consensus client. This is a shared JWT secret the clients use to authenticate each other when using the [Engine API](../../how-to/use-engine-api.md).

### 2. Generate validator keys

If you're running the consensus client as a beacon node only, skip to the [next step](#3-start-besu).

If you're also running the consensus client as a validator client, create a test Ethereum address (you can do this in [MetaMask](https://metamask.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360015289452-How-to-create-an-additional-account-in-your-wallet)). Fund this address with testnet ETH (32 ETH and gas fees for each validator) using a faucet. See the list of [Holesky faucets](https://github.com/eth-clients/holesky) and [Sepolia faucets](https://github.com/eth-clients/sepolia#meta-data-sepolia).

:::note

If you can't get ETH using the faucet, you can ask for help on the [EthStaker Discord](https://discord.io/ethstaker).

:::

Generate validator keys for one or more validators using the [Holesky Staking Launchpad](https://holesky.launchpad.ethereum.org/) (or [request to become validator on Sepolia](https://notes.ethereum.org/zvkfSmYnT0-uxwwEegbCqg)).

:::info

Save the password you use to generate each key pair in a `.txt` file. You should also have a `.json` file for each validator key pair.

:::

### 3. Start Besu

Run the following command or specify the options in a [configuration file](../../how-to/use-configuration-file/index.md):

<Tabs>

<TabItem value="Holesky" label="Holesky">

```bash
besu \
  --network=holesky           \
  --rpc-http-enabled=true     \
  --rpc-http-host=0.0.0.0     \
  --rpc-http-cors-origins="*" \
  --rpc-ws-enabled=true       \
  --rpc-ws-host=0.0.0.0       \
  --host-allowlist="*"        \
  --engine-host-allowlist="*" \
  --engine-rpc-enabled        \
  --engine-jwt-secret=<path to jwtsecret.hex>
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="Sepolia" label="Sepolia">

```bash
besu \
  --network=sepolia           \
  --rpc-http-enabled=true     \
  --rpc-http-host=0.0.0.0     \
  --rpc-http-cors-origins="*" \
  --rpc-ws-enabled=true       \
  --rpc-ws-host=0.0.0.0       \
  --host-allowlist="*"        \
  --engine-host-allowlist="*" \
  --engine-rpc-enabled        \
  --engine-jwt-secret=<path to jwtsecret.hex>
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

Specify the path to the `jwtsecret.hex` file generated in [step 1](#1-generate-the-shared-secret) using the [`--engine-jwt-secret`](../../reference/cli/options.md#engine-jwt-secret) option.

You can modify the option values and add other [command line options](../../reference/cli/options.md) as needed.

### 4. Start the consensus client

Refer to your consensus client documentation to configure and start the consensus client.

:::info

If you're running a validator client, make sure you set a fee recipient address.

:::

If you're using Teku, follow the [Besu and Teku testnet tutorial](../../tutorials/besu-teku-testnet.md#5-start-teku).

### 5. Wait for the clients to sync

After starting Besu and the consensus client, your node starts syncing and connecting to peers.

If you're running the consensus client as a beacon node only, you're all set. If you're also running the consensus client as a validator client, ensure your clients are fully synced before submitting your staking deposit in the next step. This can take several days.

### 6. Stake ETH

Stake your testnet ETH for one or more validators using the [Holesky Staking Launchpad](https://holesky.launchpad.ethereum.org/).

You can check your validator status by searching your Ethereum address on the [Holesky Beacon Chain explorer](https://holesky.beaconcha.in/). It may take up to multiple days for your validator to be activated and start proposing blocks.
