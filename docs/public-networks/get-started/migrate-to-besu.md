# Migrate to Besu

Migrate from a different Ethereum [execution client](../concepts/the-merge.md#execution-clients)
to Besu to contribute to [client diversity](https://clientdiversity.org/).

To migrate from a different client,
[configure Besu as an execution client](../how-to/prepare-for-the-merge.md#configure-besu-as-an-execution-client)
and connect your [consensus client](../concepts/the-merge.md#consensus-clients) to Besu instead of
your original execution client.

To minimize downtime while [Besu syncs](connect/sync-node.md) and avoid downtime penalties,
you can sync Besu with a new consensus layer instance.
Once Besu has fully synced you can connect it to your existing consensus client.

Find guides to switch from specific clients on the [client diversity website](https://clientdiversity.org/#switch).
