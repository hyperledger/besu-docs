# System requirements

Determine public network system requirements by checking CPU and disk space requirements using
[Prometheus](../how-to/monitor/metrics.md).
Grafana provides a [sample dashboard](https://grafana.com/grafana/dashboards/10273) for Besu.

!!! tip

    CPU requirements are highest when syncing to the network and typically reduce after the node is
    synchronized to the chain head.

## Java Virtual Machine size

For Mainnet and testnets, the minimum Java Virtual Machine (JVM) memory requirement is 8 GB.

JVM memory requirements are highest when syncing, but will reduce after the node is synchronized
to the chain head. Monitor your system to determine your actual JVM memory needs.

## Disk space

[Fast synchronization](../reference/cli/options.md#sync-mode) with
[pruning](../concepts/data-storage-formats.md) enabled requires approximately 750 GB of disk space.
[Full synchronization](../reference/cli/options.md#sync-mode) requires approximately 3 TB.

## Disk type

Use [local SSD storage](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks) for high throughput nodes (validators and RPC nodes).
Read-only nodes can use a lower performance setup.

You can use local SSDs through [SCSI interfaces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SCSI).
For higher performance in production settings, we recommend upgrading to
[NVMe interfaces](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/local-ssd#performance).

## AWS requirements

We are running 1.4.5 Mainnet nodes using `t3.large` boxes.

We synchronized the 1.4.5 Mainnet nodes using `t3.xlarge` boxes.

Using a larger box while synchronizing speeds up the sync process by giving it more resources. When the
sync is completed, the box size can be reduced.

!!! important

    If you are using a more recent release that 1.4.5, resource requirements may have increased.
