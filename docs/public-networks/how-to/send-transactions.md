# Create and send transactions

You can send signed transactions using the [`eth_sendRawTransaction`](../reference/api/index.md#eth_sendrawtransaction) JSON-RPC API method.

Signed transactions can be simple value transfers, contract creation, or contract invocation. Set the maximum transaction fee for transactions using the [`--rpc-tx-feecap`](../reference/cli/options.md#rpc-tx-feecap) CLI option.

To accept signed transactions from remote connections, set the [API listening host](use-besu-api/index.md#service-hosts) to `0.0.0.0`.

[Use client libraries](develop/client-libraries.md) to create and send a signed raw transaction to transfer Ether and create a smart contract.

:::danger Private keys

Don't use the accounts from the examples on Mainnet or any public network except for testing. The private keys are displayed which means the accounts are not secure.

All accounts and private keys in the examples are from the `dev.json` genesis file in the [`/besu/config/src/main/resources`](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/tree/master/config/src/main/resources) directory.

In production environments avoid exposing your private keys by creating signed transactions offline, or use [EthSigner](https://docs.ethsigner.consensys.net/) to isolate your private keys and sign transactions with [`eth_sendTransaction`](https://docs.ethsigner.consensys.net/Reference/API-Methods#eth_sendtransaction).

:::

:::caution

Setting the [listening host](use-besu-api/index.md#service-hosts) to `0.0.0.0` exposes the API service connection on your node to any remote connection. In a production environment, ensure you are using a firewall to avoid exposing your node to the internet.

:::tip

Libraries such as [web3j](https://github.com/web3j/web3j) or [ethereumj](https://github.com/ethereum/ethereumj) and tools such as [MyCrypto](https://mycrypto.com/) can also create signed transactions.

## `eth_call` vs `eth_sendRawTransaction`

You can interact with contracts using [`eth_call`](../reference/api/index.md#eth_call) or [`eth_sendRawTransaction`](../reference/api/index.md#eth_sendrawtransaction). The table below compares the characteristics of both calls.

| `eth_call` | `eth_sendRawTransaction` |
| --- | --- |
| Read-only | Write |
| Invokes contract function locally | Broadcasts to the network |
| Does not change state of blockchain | Updates the blockchain (for example, transfers ether between accounts) |
| Does not consume gas | Requires gas |
| Synchronous | Asynchronous |
| Returns the value of a contract function available immediately | Returns transaction hash only. A block might not include all possible transactions (for example, if the gas price is too low). |

## Use wallets for key management

Besu doesn't support key management inside the client. Use:

- [EthSigner](http://docs.ethsigner.consensys.net/en/latest/) with Besu to provide access to your key store and sign transactions.
- Third-party tools (for example, [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) and [web3j](https://web3j.io/)) for creating accounts.

:::tip

[EthSigner](http://docs.ethsigner.consensys.net/en/latest/) implements [`eth_sendTransaction`](https://docs.ethsigner.consensys.net/Reference/API-Methods#eth_sendtransaction) and [`eea_sendTransaction`](https://docs.ethsigner.consensys.net/Reference/API-Methods#eea_sendtransaction).
