# Hyperledger Besu for public networks

Besu serves as an [execution client](concepts/the-merge.md) on public proof-of-stake Ethereum
networks such as Ethereum Mainnet, Ropsten, Goerli, Sepolia, and the Merge testnet.

You can also run Besu using proof of work on [Ethereum Classic](../global/how-to/configure/mining.md).
