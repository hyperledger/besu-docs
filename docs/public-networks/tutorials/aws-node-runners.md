# Deploy AWS Node Runners

[AWS Blockchain Node Runners](https://aws-samples.github.io/aws-blockchain-node-runners/docs/intro)
is an open-source initiative aimed at simplifying the deployment of self-managed blockchain nodes
on AWS using vetted deployment blueprints and infrastructure configurations. 
AWS Node Runners solves common challenges in architecting and deploying blockchain nodes on AWS,
helping users identify optimal configurations for specific protocol clients.

This page walks you through the AWS Node Runners [architecture](#architecture), and how to
[deploy Besu and Teku on AWS](#deploy-aws-node-runners).

## Architecture

AWS Blockchain Node Runners supports several Ethereum client combinations and offers two
configuration options: a single node setup for development environments, and a highly available
multi-node setup for production environments.
The following diagrams illustrate the high level architecture of these setups.

### Single RPC node setup

<br/>
<p align="center">

![Architecture-PoC](../../assets/images/aws-node-runners-1.png)

</p>
<br/>

This single node setup is for small-scale development environments.
It deploys a single EC2 instance with both consensus and execution clients.
The RPC port is exposed only to the internal IP range of the VPC, while P2P ports allow external access to keep the clients synced.

### Highly available setup

<br/>
<p align="center">

![Architecture](../../assets/images/aws-node-runners-2.png)

</p>
<br/>

In this highly available, multiple node setup:

1. The sync node synchronizes data continuously with the Ethereum network.
1. The sync node copies node state data to an Amazon S3 bucket.
1. New RPC nodes copy state data from the Amazon S3 bucket to accelerate their initial sync.
1. The Application Load Balancer routes application and smart contract development tool requests to available RPC nodes.

### Architecture checklist

The following is a checklist for an implementation of the AWS Blockchain Node Runners. 
This checklist takes into account questions from the [AWS Well-Architected framework](https://aws.amazon.com/architecture/well-architected/)
that are relevant to this workload. 
You can add more checks from the framework if required for your workload.

## Deploy Besu and Teku on AWS

:::note
In this guide, you'll set all major configuration through environment variables, but you can also
modify parameters in the `config/config.ts` file.
:::

### 1. Configure the AWS CloudShell

#### 1.1. Log into AWS

Log in to your [AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/) with permissions to create and modify
resources in IAM, EC2, EBS, VPC, S3, KMS, and Secrets Manager. 
From the AWS Management Console, open the [AWS CloudShell](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudshell/latest/userguide/welcome.html),
a web-based shell environment.
For more information, see [this demo](https://youtu.be/fz4rbjRaiQM) on
[CloudShell with VPC environment](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudshell/latest/userguide/creating-vpc-environment.html),
which you'll use to test APIs from an internal IP address space.

#### 1.2. Install dependencies

To deploy and test blueprints in the CloudShell, clone the following repository and install dependencies: 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-blockchain-node-runners.git
cd aws-blockchain-node-runners
npm install
```

### 2. Prepare to deploy nodes

In the root directory of your project:

1. If you have deleted or don't have the default VPC, create a default VPC:

    ```bash
    aws ec2 create-default-vpc
    ```
  
    :::note
    You might see the following error if the default VPC already exists: 
    
    ```bash
    An error occurred (DefaultVpcAlreadyExists) when calling the CreateDefaultVpc operation: A Default VPC already exists for this account in this region.
    ``` 
   
    This means that the default VPC must have at least two public subnets in different availability
    zones, and public subnet must set `Auto-assign public IPv4 address` to `YES`.
    :::

1. Configure your Node Runners Ethereum blueprint deployment.
   To specify the Ethereum client combination you want to deploy, create your own copy of the `.env`
   file and edit it using your preferred text editor.
   The following example uses a sample configuration from the repository for a Besu and Teku node deployment:

    ```bash
    # Ensure you're in aws-blockchain-node-runners/lib/ethereum
    cd lib/ethereum
    pwd
    cp ./sample-configs/.env-besu-teku .env
    nano .env
    ```
  
    :::note
    You can find more examples for other Ethereum client combinations in the `sample-configs` directory.
    :::

1. Deploy common components, such as IAM role and Amazon S3 bucket to store data snapshots:

    ```bash
    pwd
    # Ensure you're in aws-blockchain-node-runners/lib/ethereum
    npx cdk deploy eth-common
    ```

### 3. Deploy  nodes

Deploy your node or nodes, depending on your setup:

- [Single RPC node](#31-option-1-single-rpc-node)
- [Highly available RPC nodes](#32-option-2-highly-available-rpc-nodes)

#### 3.1. (Option 1) Single RPC node

In a single RPC node setup:

1. Deploy the node:

    ```bash
    pwd
    # Ensure you're in aws-blockchain-node-runners/lib/ethereum
    npx cdk deploy eth-single-node --json --outputs-file single-node-deploy.json
    ```

    :::note
    The default VPC must have at least two public subnets in different Availability Zones, and the
    public subnets must set `Auto-assign public IPv4 address` to `YES`.
    :::

1. After starting the node, wait for the initial synchronization process to finish.
   It can take half a day to approximately 6-10 days, depending on the client combination and
   the network state.
   You can use Amazon CloudWatch to track the progress, which publishes metrics every five minutes.
   Watch `sync distance` for the consensus client, and `blocks behind` for the execution client.
   When the node is fully synced, those two metrics should be `0`.
   To see them:

   - Navigate to [CloudWatch service](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/) (ensure you're
     in the region you specified for `AWS_REGION`).
   - Open `Dashboards` and select `eth-sync-node-<your-eth-client-combination>` from the list of dashboards.

1. Once the initial synchronization is done, you can access the RPC API of that node from within the
   same VPC.
   The RPC port is not exposed to the Internet.
   Run the following query against the private IP of the single RPC node you deployed:

    ```bash
    INSTANCE_ID=$(cat single-node-deploy.json | jq -r '..|.node-instance-id? | select(. != null)')
    NODE_INTERNAL_IP=$(aws ec2 describe-instances --instance-ids $INSTANCE_ID --query 'Reservations[*].Instances[*].PrivateIpAddress' --output text)
    echo "NODE_INTERNAL_IP=$NODE_INTERNAL_IP"
    ```

    Copy the output from the last `echo` command with `NODE_INTERNAL_IP=<internal_IP>` and open
    [CloudShell tab with VPC environment](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudshell/latest/userguide/creating-vpc-environment.html)
    to access the internal IP address space.
    Paste `NODE_INTERNAL_IP=<internal_IP>` into the new CloudShell tab.
    Then, query the API:
    
    ``` bash
    # IMPORTANT: Run from CloudShell VPC environment tab
    # This queries the token balance of a Beacon deposit contract: https://etherscan.io/address/0x00000000219ab540356cbb839cbe05303d7705fa
    curl http://$NODE_INTERNAL_IP:8545 -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    --data '{"method":"eth_getBalance","params":["0x00000000219ab540356cBB839Cbe05303d7705Fa", "latest"],"id":1,"jsonrpc":"2.0"}'
    ```

    The result should look like the following (the actual balance might change):
    
    ```javascript
    {"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"result":"0xe791d050f91d9949d344d"}
    ```

#### 3.2. (Option 2) Highly available RPC nodes

In a highly available multi-node setup:

1. Deploy the sync node:

    ```bash
    pwd
    # Ensure you're in aws-blockchain-node-runners/lib/ethereum
    npx cdk deploy eth-sync-node --json --outputs-file sync-node-deploy.json
    ```
   
    :::note
    The default VPC must have at least two public subnets in different Availability Zones, and the
    public subnets must set `Auto-assign public IPv4 address` to `YES`.
    :::

1. After starting the node, wait for the initial synchronization process to finish.
   It can take from half a day to approximately 6-10 days, depending on the client combination and
   the network state.
   You can use Amazon CloudWatch to track the progress, which publishes metrics every five minutes.
   Watch `sync distance` for the consensus client, and `blocks behind` for the execution client.
   When the node is fully synced, those two metrics should be `0`.
   To see them:

    - Navigate to [CloudWatch service](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/) (make sure you are
    in the region you have specified for `AWS_REGION`).
    - Open `Dashboards` and select `eth-sync-node-<your-eth-client-combination>` from the list of dashboards.

    Once the synchronization process is over, the script automatically stops both clients and copies
    all the contents of the `/data` directory to your snapshot S3 bucket.
    That can take from 30 minutes to approximately 2 hours.
    During the process, you will see lower CPU and RAM usage, but high data disc throughput and
    outbound network traffic.
    The script automatically starts the clients after the process is done.
    
    :::note
    The snapshot backup process automatically runs every day at midnight of the time zone were the
    sync node runs.
    To change the schedule, modify `crontab` of the root user on the node's EC2 instance.
    :::

1. Configure and deploy two RPC nodes:

    ```bash
    pwd
    # Ensure you're in aws-blockchain-node-runners/lib/ethereum
    npx cdk deploy eth-rpc-nodes --json --outputs-file rpc-node-deploy.json
    ```

1. Give the new RPC nodes approximately 30 minutes to initialize, then run the following query
   against the load balancer behind the RPC node created:

    ```bash
    export ETH_RPC_ABL_URL=$(cat rpc-node-deploy.json | jq -r '..|.alburl? | select(. != null)')
    echo ETH_RPC_ABL_URL=$ETH_RPC_ABL_URL
    ```
    
    ```bash
    # IMPORTANT: Run from CloudShell VPC environment tab
    # We query token balance of Beacon deposit contract: https://etherscan.io/address/0x00000000219ab540356cbb839cbe05303d7705fa
    curl http://$ETH_RPC_ABL_URL:8545 -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     --data '{"method":"eth_getBalance","params":["0x00000000219ab540356cBB839Cbe05303d7705Fa", "latest"],"id":1,"jsonrpc":"2.0"}'
    ```
    
    The result should look like the following (the actual balance might change):
    
    ```javascript
    {"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"result":"0xe791d050f91d9949d344d"}
    ```

    If the nodes are still starting and catching up with the chain, you will see the following response:

    ```HTML
    <html>
    <head><title>503 Service Temporarily Unavailable</title></head>
    <body>
    <center><h1>503 Service Temporarily Unavailable</h1></center>
    </body>
    ```

    :::note
    By default and for security reasons, the load balancer is available only from within the default
    VPC in the region where it is deployed.
    It is not available from the Internet and is not open for external connections.
    Before opening it up, protect your RPC APIs.
    :::

### 4. Clear and undeploy nodes

To clear and undeploy the RPC nodes, sync nodes, and common components, use the following commands:

```bash
# Set the AWS account ID and region in case the local .env file is lost.
export AWS_ACCOUNT_ID=<your_target_AWS_account_id>
export AWS_REGION=<your_target_AWS_region>

pwd
# Ensure you're in aws-blockchain-node-runners/lib/ethereum.

# Destroy the single RPC node.
cdk destroy eth-single-node

# Destroy multiple RPC nodes.
cdk destroy eth-rpc-nodes

# Destroy the sync node.
cdk destroy eth-sync-node

# You need to manually delete an s3 bucket with a name similar to 'eth-snapshots-$accountid-eth-nodes-common'
# on the console:
#  1. Empty the bucket
#  2. Delete the bucket
#  3. Execute and delete all common components like IAM role and Security Group
cdk destroy eth-common
```
