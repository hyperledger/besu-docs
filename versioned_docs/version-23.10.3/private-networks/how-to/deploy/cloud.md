# Deploy Besu to the cloud

When deploying Besu to the cloud:

- Ensure you have enough spread across Availability Zones (AZs) and Regions, especially for bootnodes and validators.
- If your network is a multi-region network, consider using VPC Peering to reduce latency.
- Where required, use VPNs to connect to your on premise systems, or single private chains.
- If deploying to Kubernetes, please refer to the [tutorial](../../tutorials/kubernetes/index.md).
