# Connect to Mainnet

:::info

[The Merge](../../concepts/the-merge.md) was executed on **September 15, 2022**. Ethereum is now a [proof of stake](../../concepts/proof-of-stake/index.md) network, and a full Ethereum node requires both [an execution client and a consensus client](../../concepts/the-merge.md#execution-and-consensus-clients).

:::

Run Besu as an [execution client](../../concepts/the-merge.md#execution-clients) with any consensus client on Ethereum Mainnet.

If you're using [Teku] as a consensus client, you can follow the [Besu and Teku Mainnet tutorial](../../tutorials/besu-teku-mainnet.md).

## Prerequisites

- [Besu installed](../install/binary-distribution.md).
- A consensus client installed. For example, [Teku](https://docs.teku.consensys.net/en/latest/).

## Steps

### 1. Generate the shared secret

Run the following command:

```bash
openssl rand -hex 32 | tr -d "\n" > jwtsecret.hex
```

You will specify `jwtsecret.hex` when starting Besu and the consensus client. This is a shared JWT secret the clients use to authenticate each other when using the [Engine API](../../how-to/use-engine-api.md).

### 2. Generate validator keys

If you're running the consensus client as a beacon node only, skip to the [next step](#3-start-besu).

If you're also running the consensus client as a validator client, have a funded Ethereum address ready (32 ETH and gas fees for each validator).

Generate validator keys for one or more validators using the [Staking Launchpad](https://launchpad.ethereum.org/en/).

:::info

Save the password you use to generate each key pair in a `.txt` file. You should also have a `.json` file for each validator key pair.

:::

### 3. Start Besu

Run the following command or specify the options in a [configuration file](../../how-to/configuration-file.md):

```bash
besu \
  --sync-mode=X_SNAP           \
  --data-storage-format=BONSAI \
  --rpc-http-enabled=true      \
  --rpc-http-host=0.0.0.0      \
  --rpc-ws-enabled=true        \
  --rpc-ws-host=0.0.0.0        \
  --host-allowlist=<IP of Besu node>,127.0.0.1,localhost        \
  --engine-host-allowlist=<IP of Besu node>,127.0.0.1,localhost \
  --engine-rpc-enabled        \
  --engine-jwt-secret=<path to jwtsecret.hex>
```

Specify:

- The path to the `jwtsecret.hex` file generated in [step 1](#1-generate-the-shared-secret) using the [`--engine-jwt-secret`](../../reference/cli/options.md#engine-jwt-secret) option.
- The IP address of your Besu node using the [`--host-allowlist`](../../reference/cli/options.md#host-allowlist) and [`--engine-host-allowlist`](../../reference/cli/options.md#engine-host-allowlist) options.

Also, in the command:

- [`--sync-mode`](../../reference/cli/options.md#sync-mode) specifies using [snap sync](sync-node.md#snap-synchronization).
- [`--data-storage-format`](../../reference/cli/options.md#data-storage-format) specifies using [Bonsai Tries](../../concepts/data-storage-formats.md#bonsai-tries).
- [`--rpc-http-enabled`](../../reference/cli/options.md#rpc-http-enabled) enables the HTTP JSON-RPC service.
- [`--rpc-http-host`](../../reference/cli/options.md#rpc-http-host) is set to `0.0.0.0` to allow remote RPC connections.
- [`--rpc-ws-enabled`](../../reference/cli/options.md#rpc-ws-enabled) enables the WebSocket JSON-RPC service.
- [`--rpc-ws-host`](../../reference/cli/options.md#rpc-ws-host) is set to `0.0.0.0` to allow remote RPC connections.
- [`--engine-rpc-enabled`](../../reference/cli/options.md#engine-rpc-enabled) enables the [Engine API](../../reference/engine-api/index.md).

You can modify the option values and add other [command line options](../../reference/cli/options.md) as needed.

### 4. Start the consensus client

Refer to your consensus client documentation to configure and start the consensus client.

:::info

If you're running a validator client, make sure you set a fee recipient address.

:::

If you're using Teku, follow the [Besu and Teku Mainnet tutorial](../../tutorials/besu-teku-mainnet.md#5-start-teku).

### 5. Wait for the clients to sync

After starting Besu and the consensus client, your node starts syncing and connecting to peers.

If you're running the consensus client as a beacon node only, you're all set. If you're also running the consensus client as a validator client, ensure your clients are fully synced before submitting your staking deposit in the next step. Syncing Besu can take several days.

### 6. Stake ETH

Stake your ETH for one or more validators using the [Staking Launchpad](https://launchpad.ethereum.org/en/).

You can check your validator status by searching your Ethereum address on the [Beacon Chain explorer](https://beaconcha.in/). It may take up to multiple days for your validator to be activated and start proposing blocks.
