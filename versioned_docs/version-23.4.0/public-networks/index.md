# Hyperledger Besu for public networks

Besu serves as an [execution client](concepts/the-merge.md#execution-clients) on public proof-of-stake Ethereum networks such as Ethereum Mainnet, Goerli, and Sepolia.

You can also run Besu using proof of work on [Ethereum Classic (ETC)](how-to/use-pow/mining.md).

Get started by [installing Besu](get-started/install/index.md).
