# Monitoring

Use monitoring to identify node and network issues. In private networks, you can [configure metrics and logging](../../../public-networks/how-to/monitor/index.md) as in public networks.

You can also use the following monitoring tools in private networks:

- [Loki](loki.md)
- [Elastic Stack](elastic-stack.md)
- [Quorum Hibernate](quorum-hibernate.md)
- [Splunk](splunk.md)
- [OpenTelemetry](opentelemetry.md)
- [Chainlens Explorer](chainlens.md)

For an overview of monitoring Hyperledger Besu, view [this recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7BuutRe0I28&feature=youtu.be).
