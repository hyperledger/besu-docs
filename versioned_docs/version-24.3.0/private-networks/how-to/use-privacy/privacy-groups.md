# Create and manage privacy groups

Hyperledger Besu-extended privacy provides JSON-RPC API methods for creating and managing privacy groups:

- [`priv_createPrivacyGroup`](../../reference/api/index.md#priv_createprivacygroup)
- [`priv_findPrivacyGroup`](../../reference/api/index.md#priv_findprivacygroup)
- [`priv_deletePrivacyGroup`](../../reference/api/index.md#priv_deleteprivacygroup).

:::tip

You can find and delete [EEA-compliant privacy groups](../../concepts/privacy/privacy-groups.md) using [`priv_findPrivacyGroup`](../../reference/api/index.md#priv_findprivacygroup) and [`priv_deletePrivacyGroup`](../../reference/api/index.md#priv_deleteprivacygroup).
