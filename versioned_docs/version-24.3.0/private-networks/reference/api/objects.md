# Private network API objects

The following objects are parameters for or returned by Besu private network API methods.

:::caution Important

This reference contains API objects that apply to only private networks. For API objects that apply to both private and public networks, see the [public network API objects reference](../../../public-networks/reference/api/objects.md).

| `input` | Data | The data to create or invoke a contract. |
| `nonce` | Quantity | Number of transactions made by the sender to the privacy group before this one. |
| `to` | Data, 20&nbsp;bytes | `null` if a contract creation transaction, otherwise, the contract address. |
| `value` | Quantity | `null` because private transactions cannot transfer Ether. |
| `v` | Quantity | ECDSA Recovery ID. |

| `privateFrom` | Data, 32&nbsp;bytes | [Tessera](https://docs.tessera.consensys.net/) public key of the sender. |
| `privateFor` | Array of Data, 32&nbsp;bytes each | [Tessera](https://docs.tessera.consensys.net/) public keys of recipients. Not returned if using `privacyGroupId` to [send the transaction](../../../private-networks/concepts/privacy/privacy-groups.md#privacy-types). |
| `privacyGroupId` | Data, 32&nbsp;bytes | [Tessera](https://docs.tessera.consensys.net/) privacy group ID of recipients. Not returned if using `privateFor` to [send the transaction](../../../private-networks/concepts/privacy/privacy-groups.md#privacy-types). |
