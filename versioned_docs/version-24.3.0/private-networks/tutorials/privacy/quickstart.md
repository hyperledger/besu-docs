# Create a privacy-enabled network using the Quorum Developer Quickstart

You can create a privacy-enabled network using the [Quorum Developer Quickstart](../quickstart.md). It runs a private Hyperledger Besu network that uses [Tessera](https://docs.tessera.consensys.net/en/stable/) as its private transaction manager.

You can use the [Block Explorer](../quickstart.md#block-explorer), make [JSON-RPC requests](../quickstart.md#run-json-rpc-requests), and [create transactions using MetaMask](../quickstart.md#create-a-transaction-using-metamask). This tutorial describes how to make private transactions between nodes, and perform read and write operations on private contracts.

:::important

This tutorial runs a private network suitable for education or demonstration purposes and is not intended for running production networks.

:::

## Prerequisites

To run this tutorial, you must have the following installed:

- [Docker and Docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

  :::important

  If using [MacOS](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/) or [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-windows/), enable Docker to use up to 6GB of memory on the _Advanced_ tab in _Preferences_.

  :::

- [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- [Git command line](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Curl command line](https://curl.haxx.se/download.html).

## Create Docker-compose file

## Usage

To create the docker-compose file and artifacts, run:

```bash
npx quorum-dev-quickstart
```

Follow the prompts displayed to run Hyperledger Besu, private transactions, and [logging with ELK](../../how-to/monitor/elastic-stack.md). Enter `n` for [Codefi Orchestrate](https://docs.orchestrate.consensys.net/en/stable/).

## Start the network

:::caution

If running in Windows, please run commands from the GitBash shell

:::

In the installation directory, start the network:

```bash
./run.sh
```

The script pulls the Docker images starts the network. Pulling the images takes a few minutes the first time. The network details display.

```bash

## Deploy the private contract and interact with the nodes

To deploy a private contract to another [privacy group](../../concepts/privacy/privacy-groups.md) member, use the [web3js-quorum](https://consensys.github.io/web3js-quorum/latest/index.html) library and the [`eea_sendRawTransaction`](../../../private-networks/reference/api/index.md#eea_sendrawtransaction) API call. You must use this API call instead of [`eth_sendTransaction`](https://ethereum.github.io/execution-apis/api-documentation) because Hyperledger Besu keeps account management separate for stronger security.

This example uses the [web3js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/web3) library to make the API calls, the example creates three Besu nodes, with each node having a corresponding Tessera node for privacy. You can access the Besu member nodes for API calls on the following ports:

```bash
Member1Besu RPC: http://localhost:20000
Member1Tessera: http://localhost:9081

Member2Besu RPC: http://localhost:20002
Member2Tessera: http://localhost:9082

Member3Besu RPC: http://localhost:20004
Member3Tessera: http://localhost:9083
```

Navigate to the `smart_contracts` directory and deploy the private transaction:

```bash
cd smart_contracts
npm install
node scripts/private/private_tx.js
```

The script deploys the contract and sends an arbitrary value (47) from `Member1` to `Member3`. Once done, it queries all three members (Tessera) to check the value at an address. Only `Member1` & `Member3` has this information as they were involved in the transaction, `Member2` responds with a `0x` to indicate it is unaware of the transaction.

```bash
node scripts/private/private_tx.js

```

The general contract deployment flow is:

1. Deploy a contract, which returns a transaction hash.

1. Obtain the privacy transaction receipt from the transaction hash.

1. Use the contract address in the privacy transaction receipt to [interact with the contract](../contracts/interact.md) from that point on.

## Further examples

View the [web3js-quorum client library example](web3js-quorum.md) and view the [sample code examples](https://github.com/ConsenSys/web3js-quorum/tree/master/example).

You can also test the erc20 token example by executing `erc20.js` which deploys a `HumanStandardToken` contract and transfers 1 token to Node2.

This can be verified from the `data` field of the `logs` which is `1`.

## Stop the network

Do one of the following to stop the network:

- Stop the network:

  ```bash
  ./stop.sh
  ```

- Stop the network and remove the containers and volumes:

  ```bash
  ./remove.sh
  ```
