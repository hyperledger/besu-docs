# Configure Clique consensus

Besu implements the [Clique](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-225) proof of authority (PoA) [consensus protocol](index.md). Private networks can use Clique.

:::danger

Clique is not suitable for production environments. Use only in development environments.

:::

In Clique networks, approved accounts, known as signers, validate transactions and blocks. Signers take turns to create the next block. Existing signers propose and vote to [add or remove signers](#add-and-remove-signers).

You can [create a private network using Clique](../../../tutorials/clique.md).

## Genesis file

To use Clique in a private network, Besu requires a Clique [genesis file](../../../../public-networks/concepts/genesis-file.md).

A Clique genesis file defines properties specific to Clique.

```json title="Example Clique genesis file"
{
  "config": {
    "chainId": 1981,
    "berlinBlock": 0,
    "clique": {
      "blockperiodseconds": 15,
      "epochlength": 30000,
      "createemptyblocks": true
    }
  },
  "coinbase": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
  "difficulty": "0x1",
  "extraData": "0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001a54556254bfa3db2daa7673435ec63649925c50000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
  "gasLimit": "0x1fffffffffffff",
  "mixHash": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000",
  "nonce": "0x0",
  "timestamp": "0x5c51a607",
  "alloc": {},
  "number": "0x0",
  "gasUsed": "0x0",
  "parentHash": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000"
}
```

The properties specific to Clique are:

- `blockperiodseconds` - The block time, in seconds.
- `epochlength` - The number of blocks after which to reset all votes.
- `createemptyblocks` - Set to false to [skip creating empty blocks](#skip-empty-blocks).
- `extraData` - [Extra data](#extra-data) including the initial signers.

### Skip empty blocks

By default, Clique creates empty blocks. For large private networks using Clique, skipping empty blocks can reduce the storage needed.

To skip creating empty blocks, set `createemptyblocks` to `false` in the genesis file: 

```json
{
  "config": {
    "londonBlock": 0,
    "clique": {
      "blockperiodseconds": 10,
      "epochlength": 30000,
      "createemptyblocks": false
    }
  },
...
}
```

All validators must have the same value for `createemptyblocks`. 

### Extra data

The `extraData` property consists of:

- 0x prefix.
- 32 bytes of vanity data.
- A list of initial signer addresses (at least one initial signer is required). 20 bytes for each signer.
- 65 bytes for the proposer signature. In the genesis block there is no initial proposer, so the proposer signature is all zeros.

### One initial signer

![One Initial Signer](../../../../assets/images/CliqueOneIntialSigner.png)

### Two initial signers

![Two Initial Signers](../../../../assets/images/CliqueTwoIntialSigners.png)

### Post-Merge configuration

After [The Merge](../../../../public-networks/concepts/the-merge.md), the following block fields are modified or deprecated. Their fields **must** contain only the constant values from the following chart.

| Field            | Constant value                                                       | Comment                    |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------|
| **`ommersHash`** | `0x1dcc4de8dec75d7aab85b567b6ccd41ad312451b948a7413f0a142fd40d49347` | `= Keccak256(RLP([]))`     |
| **`difficulty`** | `0`                                                                  | Replaced with `prevrandao` |
| **`mixHash`**    | `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000` | Replaced with `prevrandao` |
| **`nonce`**      | `0x0000000000000000`                                                 |                            |
| **`ommers`**     | `[]`                                                                 | `RLP([]) = 0xc0`           |

Additionally, [`extraData`](#extra-data) is limited to 32 bytes of vanity data after The Merge.

## Connect to a Clique network

To start a node on a Clique private network, use the [`--genesis-file`](../../../../public-networks/reference/cli/options.md#genesis-file) option to specify the custom genesis file.

## Add and remove signers

Existing signers propose and vote to add or remove validators using the Clique JSON-RPC API methods. Enable the HTTP interface with [`--rpc-http-enabled`](../../../../public-networks/reference/cli/options.md#rpc-http-enabled) or the WebSocket interface with [`--rpc-ws-enabled`](../../../../public-networks/reference/cli/options.md#rpc-ws-enabled).

The Clique API methods are disabled by default. To enable them, specify the [`--rpc-http-api`](../../../../public-networks/reference/cli/options.md#rpc-http-api) or [`--rpc-ws-api`](../../../../public-networks/reference/cli/options.md#rpc-ws-api) option and include `CLIQUE`.

The methods to add or remove signers are:

- [`clique_propose`](../../../reference/api/index.md#clique_propose).
- [`clique_getSigners`](../../../reference/api/index.md#clique_getsigners).
- [`clique_discard`](../../../reference/api/index.md#clique_discard).

To view signer metrics for a specified block range, call [`clique_getSignerMetrics`](../../../reference/api/index.md#clique_getsignermetrics).

### Add a signer

To propose adding a signer to a Clique network, call [`clique_propose`](../../../reference/api/index.md#clique_propose), specifying the address of the proposed signer and `true`. A majority of signers must execute the call.

```bash title="JSON-RPC clique_propose request example"
curl -X POST --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"clique_propose","params":["0xFE3B557E8Fb62b89F4916B721be55cEb828dBd73", true], "id":1}' <JSON-RPC-endpoint:port>
```

When the signer creates the next block, the signer adds a vote to the block for the proposed signer.

When more than 50% of the existing signers propose adding the signer, with their votes distributed in blocks, the signer can begin signing blocks.

To return a list of signers and confirm the addition of a proposed signer, call [`clique_getSigners`](../../../reference/api/index.md#clique_getsigners).

```bash title="JSON-RPC clique_getSigners request example"
curl -X POST --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"clique_getSigners","params":["latest"], "id":1}' <JSON-RPC-endpoint:port>
```

To discard your proposal after confirming the addition of a signer, call [`clique_discard`](../../../reference/api/index.md#clique_discard) specifying the address of the proposed signer.

```bash title="JSON-RPC clique_discard request example"
curl -X POST --data '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"clique_discard","params":["0xFE3B557E8Fb62b89F4916B721be55cEb828dBd73"], "id":1}' <JSON-RPC-endpoint:port>
```

### Remove a signer

The process for removing a signer from a Clique network is the same as [adding a signer](#add-a-signer), except you specify `false` as the second parameter of [`clique_propose`](../../../reference/api/index.md#clique_propose).

### Epoch transition

At each epoch transition, Clique discards all pending votes collected from received blocks. Existing proposals remain in effect and signers re-add their vote the next time they create a block.

Define the number of blocks between epoch transitions in the [Clique genesis file](#genesis-file).

## Transitions

The `transitions` genesis configuration item allows you to specify a future block number at which to
change the Clique network configuration in an existing network.
For example, you can update the [block time](#configure-block-time-on-an-existing-network) and
whether to [create empty blocks](#configure-empty-blocks-on-an-existing-network).

:::caution
Do not specify a transition block in the past.
Specifying a transition block in the past can result in unexpected behavior, such as causing the
network to fork.
:::

### Configure block time on an existing network

To update an existing network with a new `blockperiodseconds`:

1. Stop all nodes in the network.
2. In the [genesis file](#genesis-file), add the `transitions` configuration item where:

    - `<FutureBlockNumber>` is the upcoming block at which to change `blockperiodseconds`.
    - `<NewValue>` is the updated value for `blockperiodseconds`.

    <Tabs>
    <TabItem value="Syntax" label="Syntax" default>

    ```json
    {
      "config": {
        ...
        "clique": {
          "blockperiodseconds": 3,
          "epochlength": 30,
          "requesttimeoutseconds": 6,
          "createemptyblocks": true
        },
        "transitions": {
          "clique": [
            {
              "block": <FutureBlockNumber>,
              "blockperiodseconds": <NewValue>
            }
          ]
        }
      },
      ...
    }
    ```

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="Example" label="Example">

    ```json
    {
      "config": {
        ...
        "clique": {
          "blockperiodseconds": 3,
          "epochlength": 30,
          "requesttimeoutseconds": 6,
          "createemptyblocks": true
        },
        "transitions": {
          "clique": [
            {
              "block": 3,
              "blockperiodseconds": 1
            },
            {
              "block": 6,
              "blockperiodseconds": 2
            },
          ]
        }
      },
      ...
    }
    ```

    </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

3. Restart all nodes in the network using the updated genesis file.
4. To verify the changes after the transition block, view the Besu logs and check that the time
   difference between each block matches the updated block period.

### Configure empty blocks on an existing network

To update an existing network with a new [`createemptyblocks`](#skip-empty-blocks):

1. Stop all nodes in the network.
2. In the [genesis file](#genesis-file), add the `transitions` configuration item where:

    - `<FutureBlockNumber>` is the upcoming block at which to change `createemptyblocks`.
    - `<NewValue>` is the updated value for `createemptyblocks`.

    <Tabs>
    <TabItem value="Syntax" label="Syntax" default>

    ```json
    {
      "config": {
        ...
        "clique": {
          "blockperiodseconds": 3,
          "epochlength": 30,
          "requesttimeoutseconds": 6,
          "createemptyblocks": true
        },
        "transitions": {
          "clique": [
            {
              "block": <FutureBlockNumber>,
              "createemptyblocks": <NewValue>
            }
          ]
        }
      },
      ...
    }
    ```

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="Example" label="Example">

    ```json
    {
      "config": {
        ...
        "clique": {
          "blockperiodseconds": 3,
          "epochlength": 30,
          "requesttimeoutseconds": 6,
          "createemptyblocks": true
        },
        "transitions": {
          "clique": [
            {
              "block": 10,
              "createemptyblocks": false
            }
          ]
        }
      },
      ...
    }
    ```

    </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

3. Restart all nodes in the network using the updated genesis file.

## Limitations

In Clique, blocks created by in-turn validators are published immediately. Out-of-turn validators create blocks that are published after a short delay. In-turn blocks have a higher difficulty than out-of-turn blocks, which allows small forks to resolve to the chain with more in-turn blocks.

However, when the out-of-turn delay is shorter than the block propagation delay, out-of-turn blocks may be published before in-turn blocks. This may cause large, irresolvable forks in a network.

:::tip

We recommend using a more updated consensus protocol such as [IBFT 2.0](ibft.md) or [QBFT](qbft.md).
